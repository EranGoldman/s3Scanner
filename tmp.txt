Case in point: Trump is said to be on the brink of appointing John Bolton as deputy secretary of state. He is arguably the man most responsible for hiding the truth about Iraq&#8217;s nonexistent WMDs.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The Bush administration, with Bolton as undersecretary of state for arms control, arrived in Washington, D.C., in 2001 with the goal of invading Iraq. They weren&#8217;t motivated by whatever WMDs Iraq might or might not have, but, as a senior administration official \u003ca href=\"http://www.tinyrevolution.com/mt/archives/000266.html\">later explained\u003c/a>, by the simple and highly galling fact of Saddam Hussein&#8217;s &#8220;defiance&#8221; of the U.S.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>When the September 11 terrorist attacks gave them the opportunity, the administration&#8217;s conservative wing, including Bolton, had no interest in sending inspectors to Iraq to see if Hussein had WMD. They wanted to simply use WMD as &#8220;\u003ca href=\"http://www.commondreams.org/headlines04/1028-01.htm\">justification you can jump on\u003c/a>&#8221; to invade &#8212; without bothering to check whether Iraq actually had anything. (It was only in the fall of 2002 that Colin Powell and Tony Blair prevailed upon Bush to go to the United Nations and go through the motions of inspections.)\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>However, Bolton and company faced an immediate obstacle: the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and its Brazilian diplomat leader José Bustani.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The OPCW had been formed in 1997, and is headquartered at the Hague in the Netherlands. It exists to administer a 1993 arms control treaty prohibiting the manufacture and use of chemical weapons.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Iraq had informed the OPCW in late 2001 that it wanted to sign the treaty. This would require Iraq to provide the organization with a list of any chemical weapons stockpiles it possessed &#8212; and submit to intrusive OPCW inspections.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This set off loud alarm bells in the Bush administration, since inspections could not just delay their desired war, but undermine the case for it in the first place. As Bustani \u003ca href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/14/world/to-ousted-boss-arms-watchdog-was-seen-as-an-obstacle-in-iraq.html\">put it\u003c/a> years later, his willingness to consider inspecting Iraq “caused an uproar in Washington,” and it quickly &#8220;became evident that the Americans were serious about getting rid of me.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>According to Bustani, “Everybody knew there weren’t any [banned chemical weapons]. An inspection would make it obvious there were no weapons to destroy. This would completely nullify the decision to invade.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The U.S. was not about to let this happen. Bolton took the lead in ousting Bustani and replacing him with someone more pliable. After the Bush administration failed to win a March 2002 no-confidence vote from OPCW&#8217;s executive committee, it threatened to cut off its funding of the OPCW, which accounted for 22 percent of its budget.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This got everyone&#8217;s attention. The next month, with Bolton in the Netherlands to supervise, the OPCW \u003ca href=\"https://2001-2009.state.gov/t/isn/cwc/fs/9631.htm\">voted to fire Bustani\u003c/a> with 48 countries voting yes, seven voting no, and 43 abstaining. A European diplomat \u003ca href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/23/world/us-forces-out-head-of-chemical-arms-agency.html\">commented\u003c/a> at the time that &#8220;I think a lot of people swallowed this because they thought it was better for Bustani to be removed than have the U.S. pull out and see the organization collapse.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Bustani could not immediately be reached for comment. In response to an interview request sent to his assistant, Bolton told her to pass along the message: &#8220;no comment &#8212; he can read my book!&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Bolton&#8217;s 2008 memoir, &#8220;\u003ca href=\"http://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Surrender-Is-Not-an-Option/John-Bolton/9781416552857\">Surrender Is Not an Option: Defending America at the United Nations\u003c/a>,&#8221; states that Bustani was &#8220;a management disaster, whose performance called into question the OPCW&#8217;s credibility and indeed the [Chemical Weapons Convention] itself. State&#8217;s arms controllers complained repeatedly about Bustani&#8217;s incompetence.&#8221; Bolton&#8217;s book does not provide any details about Bustani&#8217;s purported poor performance and incompetence.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While Bolton&#8217;s wing of the administration won that round, they were unable to prevent later inspections of Iraq under the auspices of the U.N. Those inspectors then failed to find anything &#8212; since Iraq did not actually possess any banned weapons &#8212; and the U.S. and its allies went ahead and invaded anyway in March 2003.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Bolton went on to make the bogus case for war in other ways, pushing some of the administration&#8217;s \u003ca href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=-kykEEiazfgC&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;ots=fqvnYifTUl&amp;dq=%22john%20bolton%22%20aluminum%20tubes&amp;pg=PA163#v=onepage&amp;q=%22john%20bolton%22%20aluminum%20tubes&amp;f=false\">key WMD lies\u003c/a>. In 2005, he became Bush&#8217;s ambassador to the U.N., though it took a recess appointment to do it.

Entre os sócios e representantes dessas companhias, a maior parte declarou morar em São Paulo, no Rio de Janeiro e em Portugal. Cada um desses lugares mantêm 31 registros de empresas na ilha. As firmas relacionadas aos 148 brasileiros também possuem 172 pessoas de outras nacionalidades entre sócios ou representantes. Foram registrados ainda 38 estrangeiros que declararam morar no Brasil ao abrirem suas firmas em Malta.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>O Brasil taxa em 25% as operações realizadas de empresas locais tanto para paraísos fiscais como para regimes fiscais privilegiados. Normalmente, essa taxação é de 15%. No cadastro acessado pelo EIC, estão as empresas de Malta que possuem dados públicos, boa parte classificada como &#8220;Limited&#8221;. Portanto, não há por aqui alerta especial em relação a essas firmas.

O quadro atual é extorsivo, gera uma distorção sistêmica, que é a inversão de um sistema tributário justo. Os que não têm recursos são obrigados a pagar as taxas de seus países de origem.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>O advogado ressalta que, a princípio, não há qualquer ilegalidade em um brasileiro possuir uma empresa num paraíso fiscal. Os motivos legítimos podem ir desde uma proteção maior ao investimento à busca de uma base no exterior para a expansão de negócios. Casos recentes, porém, como o da Lava Jato, têm, não à toa, levantado suspeitas generalizadas sobre o uso deste tipo de recurso:\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“Cada vez mais vamos ver as grandes empresas ponderando sobre o uso de paraísos fiscais, principalmente pelos casos recentes de repercussão negativa.

Janot argumenta que Rodrigo Rocha Loures, então assessor especial de Temer, não tinha poderes para resolver a questão sozinho e nem poderia lidar com valores tão altos sem que houvesse um aval do presidente.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch3>\u003cb>Renan\u003c/b>\u003c/h3>\n\u003cp>O caso do senador Renan Calheiros, um veterano na arte de habitar o imaginário popular da corrupção, é emblemático das diferenças. Na Lava Jato, o senador é alvo de oito inquéritos diferentes sobre supostas práticas do crime. Até aqui, Rodrigo Janot somente conseguiu finalizar uma \u003ca href=\"http://g1.globo.com/politica/operacao-lava-jato/noticia/pgr-denuncia-renan-calheiros-ao-stf-na-lava-jato.ghtml\" target=\"_blank\">denúncia contra ele\u003c/a>. Nela, o procurador-geral acusa o peemedebista de receber R$ 800 mil da empreiteira Serveng, em 2010, como contrapartida a um contrato bilionário que a empresa conseguiu com a Petrobras para a construção de uma refinaria de petróleo no Maranhão.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Aqui, Janot também constrói sua denúncia com base na associação entre Renan e um emissário – no caso, o deputado federal Aníbal Gomes (PMDB-CE). A denúncia parte de declarações dadas em acordo de delação premiada pelo ex-diretor da Petrobras Paulo Roberto Costa. Segundo Costa, ele participou de reuniões chamadas por Aníbal na casa de Renan ou no gabinete do senador no Congresso, o que levou o então diretor “a confirmar que Aníbal era emissário de Renan, agindo e atuando em comunhão de desígnios em benefício desse último”. Mas não há qualquer evidência do teor do que foi discutido nessas reuniões.\u003c/p>\n\u003cblockquote class='stylized pull-right'> A denúncia parte de declarações dadas em acordo de delação premiada pelo ex-diretor da Petrobras Paulo Roberto Costa.\u003c/blockquote>\n\u003cp>Outro detalhe é que os R$ 800 mil de que Renan teria sido beneficiário foram pagos por meio de doação oficial de campanha em uma conta formal do PMDB, registrada no TSE. Embora a Procuradoria esteja adotando em diversos casos o entendimento de que \u003ca href=\"https://jota.info/justica/2a-turma-do-stf-doacao-eleitoral-pode-maquiar-propina-07032017\" target=\"_blank\">existe corrupção mesmo quando a doação é oficial\u003c/a>, mas está atrelada a uma contrapartida do agente público no governo ou no Congresso, é uma base muito mais frágil do que o caso Temer, em que os R$ 500 mil entregues a Rodrigo Rocha Loures não tinham nenhuma relação com contexto eleitoral.\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-center  width-fixed' style='width: 1024px;'> \u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-134820\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/06/538632592-1498593343-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"TOPSHOT - Brazilian Senate President Renan Calheiros participates in a plenary session of the senate in Brasilia, on June 7, 2016.&lt;br /&gt; Brazil's Prosecutor General Rodrigo Janot has asked the Supreme Court to authorize the arrests of Senate President Renan Calheiros, former Brazilian president Jose Sarney, Senator Romero Juca and powerful lawmaker Eduardo Cunha, O Globo newspaper reported.  / AFP / ANDRESSA ANHOLETE        (Photo credit should read ANDRESSA ANHOLETE/AFP/Getty Images)\" />\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"caption\">Senador Renan Calheiros durante sessão no Senado.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class='caption source' style=''>Foto: AFP/Getty Images\u003c/p>\u003c/div>\n\u003cp>Não há gravação de conversas. A PGR se apoia em uma sequência de datas que evidenciam que a empreiteira Serveng somente conseguiu o contrato depois de doar para a campanha de Renan. “A assinatura da primeira autorização de serviço e a primeira doação da Serveng ao Diretório Nacional do PMDB serem no mesmo dia corroboram todo o esquema criminoso, deixando de ser mera coincidência de datas”, escreveu Janot no caso Renan.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Outro dado usado pela Procuradoria para reforçar a acusação contra Renan é que a empreiteira somente conseguiu o contrato porque foi convidada a disputar a licitação. E, para que o convite pudesse ser realizado, uma mudança cadastral tinha de ser feita para que a empresa aparecesse num nível melhor de qualificação. Essa mudança, segundo as investigações, aconteceu dentro de um intervalo de 50 dias entre duas visitas de Aníbal Gomes a Paulo Roberto Costa, na Petrobras. Renan não participou dessas reuniões citadas pela Procuradoria-Geral da República.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch3>\u003cb>Cunha   \u003c/b>\u003c/h3>\n\u003cp>A situação de Renan, no entanto, é bem diferente da que envolve Eduardo Cunha na primeira de três denúncias oferecidas por Janot contra ele, quando ele ainda era deputado e tinha o direito a foro privilegiado.

The \u003ca href=\"https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/r-oao-campaign-against-arms-trade-v-ssfit-and-others1.pdf\">58-page verdict\u003c/a> concluded that there was no “real risk” of “serious violations.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>CAAT said in a statement that it was “disappointed” with the ruling and plans to pursue an appeal. Nongovernmental organizations working in Yemen described the judgment as “a dark day for the people of Yemen.” More than half of the three-day hearing of the judicial review case that was held in February was closed to CAAT, the press, and the public. The judges stated that the U.K. government had “more sophisticated sources of information” than CAAT, but claimed the information could not be disclosed in open court “for national security reasons.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>British government officials licensed the sale of $4.2 billion (£3.3 billion) worth of arms to Saudi Arabia in the first 12 months of the Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen, which is now in its third year.

However, the Saudi Joint Incidents Assessment Team has released the initial results of an investigation into just 20 strikes, including attacks on two Médecins Sans Frontières-supported medical facilities in northern Yemen. In 14 of the 20 strikes, the Saudi investigators absolved the coalition of wrongdoing or responsibility for alleged violations.\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-center  width-fixed' style='width: 1024px;'>\n\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/07/yemen-hospital-cholera-humanitarian-crisis-1499439596.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-136091\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/07/yemen-hospital-cholera-humanitarian-crisis-1499439596-1024x658.jpg\" alt=\"Yemenis suspected of being infected with cholera receive treatment at a makeshift hospital in Sanaa on May 25, 2017.Cholera has killed 315 people in Yemen in under a month, the World Health Organization has said, as another aid organization warned Monday the outbreak could become a &quot;full-blown epidemic&quot;. / AFP PHOTO (Photo credit should read /AFP/Getty Images)\" />\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"caption\">Yemenis suspected of being infected with cholera receive treatment at a makeshift hospital in Sana on May 25, 2017.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class='caption source' style=''>Photo: Mohammed Huwais/AFP/Getty Images\u003c/p>\u003c/div>\n\u003cp>An array of international organizations — including a U.N. panel of experts, the European Parliament, and humanitarian and human rights groups — has repeatedly condemned the ongoing airstrikes against Yemen as unlawful. The British government has twice blocked attempts proposed through the U.N. Human Rights Council to establish a non-Saudi-led inquiry into alleged violations of international law.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Sir Vince Cable, a former British government minister, told The Intercept following Monday’s ruling: “I am disappointed by the verdict. U.K. dependence on exports to Saudi is unhealthy and is driving our foreign policy.” Cable signed off on U.K. arms sales to Saudi Arabia in his role as business secretary in 2015, the first year of the war. He has previously claimed he was “\u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/04/mod-seriously-misled-me-on-saudi-arms-sales-says-vince-cable\">seriously misled\u003c/a>” by the Ministry of Defence in the process of his decision making on whether to grant permission for sales to Saudi.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Mark Goldring, head of the U.K.-based charity Oxfam, also expressed dissatisfaction with the judgment. “So much evidence has been presented in this case of the devastating impact on Yemen from selling arms to Saudi Arabia,&#8221; said Goldring. “There is a clear moral case for the government to suspend its sales.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Human Rights Watch, which has documented numerous cases of potential war crimes in Yemen, called the verdict “a serious setback for efforts to hold the British government accountable,” adding that the judgment rejected detailed evidence gathered on the ground.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The ruling was handed down amid a rapidly deteriorating humanitarian crisis in Yemen. Seven million people are facing imminent famine, and a cholera outbreak has killed more than 1,700 people since April — a crisis described by the United Nations humanitarian chief, Stephen O’Brien, as a “man-made catastrophe” resulting from the conflict. The number of cholera cases in Yemen is escalating at more than double the rate previously predicted by the U.N.’s World Health Organization, with numbers now reaching 300,000.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The war in Yemen has had a major impact on food imports as a result of the Saudi-led coalition imposing restrictions on imports, ostensibly to prevent weapons from reaching their opponents — Yemen’s northern Houthi rebels and soldiers loyal to the country’s former president, Ali Abdullah Saleh. In peacetime, Yemen imports about 90 percent of its food. In addition, Houthi-Saleh forces have also obstructed food and aid deliveries around the country.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The conflict began in 2014 after Houthi fighters seized Yemen’s capital. It escalated in early 2015, forcing incumbent President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi into exile in Saudi Arabia. Since March 2015, Saudi, along with a coalition of regional nations backed by the U.S. and the U.K., has been trying to push back the Houthi-Saleh forces.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In 2015, The Intercept \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2015/09/01/yemen-hidden-war-saudi-coalition-killing-civilians/\">investigated\u003c/a> eight Saudi coalition strikes that killed up to 175 civilians, revealing evidence of a pattern of indiscriminate bombing of civilians and targeting of first responders. Some 10,000 people have died in the conflict, with Saudi coalition airstrikes being the “single largest cause of casualties,” according to an August 2016 U.N. report.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While Saudi Arabia is the U.K.’s top arms buyer, the U.S. is the biggest exporter of weapons and military training to the kingdom. The boom in defense sales to the Saudis is set to continue after President Donald Trump announced a record arms deal worth up to $350 billion over the next 10 years during his first foreign trip as president to Riyadh in May, beating the \u003ca href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-saudi-security-idUSKCN11D2JQ\">previous record\u003c/a> set by the Obama administration of more than $115 billion worth of sales from 2009 to 2016.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Similar recent attempts to suspend U.S. arms sales to Saudi have so far failed. The Trump administration notified Congress last month of its intention to resume the export of precision-guided weapons to the country, suspended under Obama in December.

Maia, o pai, também tinha apelidos especiais na planilha secreta da Odebrecht, divulgada este ano: \u003ca href=\"https://oglobo.globo.com/brasil/cesar-maia-citado-como-despota-rodrigo-maia-como-volante-em-inquerito-21200948\">“déspota” ou “inca”\u003c/a>.

Invariavelmente, a criação de novos registros está associada a novas obras tocadas pela empreiteira.

But Klein nonetheless pressed her on a series of criticisms that have been voiced about her and the Democrats&#8217; stunted political approach, banal policies, status-quo-perpetuating worldview, and cramped aspirations that seem far more plausible as authors of her defeat than the familiar array of villains &#8212; Bernie Sanders, Vladimir Putin, Jill Stein, Jim Comey, the New York Times &#8212; that she and her most ardent supporters are eager to blame.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Despite being illuminating, Klein&#8217;s discussion with Clinton contains a glaring though quite common omission: There is not a word about the role of foreign policy and endless war during the entire hour.

Americans of all stripes have watched each conflict’s developments unfold through extensive media coverage, movies, and personal stories from veterans returning from combat. Indeed, so great are its posited effects on American society that some analysts have proclaimed the emergence of an “Iraq Syndrome,” echoing the public skepticism about the efficacy of the use of force and the growing popular reluctance to employ it that emerged after Vietnam.\u003c/p>\u003c/blockquote>\n\u003cp>Clinton was uniquely ill-suited to channel this widespread sentiment given that she has vocally supported almost every proposed U.S. war and military intervention over the last 20 years (including ones Obama rejected in places such as Syria and Ukraine and, of course, Iraq). For that reason, she was one of the leading symbols of war and militarism, perhaps its most potent one, and Trump &#8212; however deceitful and cynical it might have been &#8212; positioned himself as her opposite.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>From these premises, the authors argue that had the U.S. fought fewer wars, or at least experienced fewer casualties, Clinton would have won those three states and thus won the election:\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-center  width-fixed' style='width: 540px;'> \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/study-1505320286.png\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-article-medium wp-image-146220\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/study-1505320286-540x452.png\" alt=\"\" />\u003c/a> \u003c/div>\n\u003cp>One need not uncritically accept this maximalist conclusion to acknowledge the vital point: Clinton specifically and Democrats generally are perceived, \u003ca href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/u-s-bombed-iraq-syria-pakistan-afghanistan-libya-yemen-somalia-n704636\">with good reason\u003c/a>, to be \u003ca href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-president-barack-obama-bomb-map-drone-wars-strikes-20000-pakistan-middle-east-afghanistan-a7534851.html\">proponents of\u003c/a> endless war policies that critical constituencies now despise.

It was the end of November, three weeks after Trump’s improbable victory, and Cohn, then still the president of Goldman Sachs, was at Trump Tower presumably at the invitation of Kushner, with whom he was friendly. Cohn was there to offer his views about jobs and the economy. But, like the man he was there to meet, he was at heart a salesman.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>On the campaign trail, Trump had spoken often about the importance of investing in infrastructure. Yet the president-elect had apparently failed to appreciate that the government would need to come up with hundreds of billions of dollars to fund his plans. Cohn, brash and bold, wired to attack any moneymaking opportunity, pitched a fix that would put Wall Street firms at the center: Private-industry partners could help infrastructure get fixed, saving the federal government from going deeper into debt.

Trump proclaimed that Hillary Clinton was in the firm’s pockets, as was Ted Cruz. It was Goldman Sachs that Trump singled out when he railed against a system rigged in favor of the global elite — one that “robbed our working class, stripped our country of wealth, and put money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations and political entities.” Cohn, as president and chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs, had been at the heart of it all. Aggressive and relentless, a former aluminum siding salesman and commodities broker with a nose for making money, Cohn had turned Goldman’s sleepy home loan unit into what a Senate staffer called “one of the largest mortgage trading desks in the world.” There, he aggressively pushed his sales team to sell mortgage-backed securities to unaware investors even as he watched over “the big short,” Goldman’s decision to bet billions of dollars that the market would collapse.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Now Cohn would be coordinating economic policy for the populist president.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The conflicts between the two men were striking. Cohn ran a giant investment bank with offices in financial capitals around the globe, one deeply committed to a world with few economic borders. Trump’s nationalist campaign contradicted everything Goldman Sachs and its top executives represented on the global stage.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Trump raged against “offshoring” by American companies during the 2016 campaign. He even threatened “retribution,”­ a 35 percent tariff on any goods imported into the United States by a company that had moved jobs overseas. But Cohn laid out Goldman’s very different view of offshoring at an investor conference in Naples, Florida, in November. There, Cohn explained unapologetically that Goldman had \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/853075/goldman-sachs-and-other-wall-street-banks-moved-thousands-of-jobs-out-of-the-us-will-trump-go-after-them-too/\">offshored\u003c/a> its back-office staff, including payroll and IT, to Bangalore, India, now home to the firm’s largest office outside New York City: “We hire people there because they work for cents on the dollar versus what people work for in the United States.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Candidate Trump promised to create millions of new jobs, \u003ca href=\"http://www.latimes.com/nation/83795186-157.html\">vowing\u003c/a> to be “the greatest jobs president that God ever created.” Cohn, as Goldman Sachs’s president and COO, oversaw the firm’s mergers and acquisitions business that had, over the previous three years, led to the loss of at least 22,000 U.S. jobs, according to a \u003ca href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzouW0SGr8rlcHRONzB1b2tZU00/view\">study\u003c/a> by two advocacy groups. Early in his candidacy, Trump described as “disgusting” Pfizer’s decision to buy a smaller Irish competitor in order to execute a “corporate inversion,” a maneuver in which a U.S. company moves its headquarters overseas to reduce its tax burden. The Pfizer deal ultimately fell through. But in 2016, in the heat of the campaign, Goldman advised on a megadeal that saw Johnson Controls, a Fortune 500 company based in Milwaukee, buy the Ireland-based Tyco International with the same goal. A few months later, with Goldman’s help, Johnson Controls had executed its inversion.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>With Cohn’s appointment, Trump now had three Goldman Sachs alums in top positions inside his administration: Steve Bannon, who was a vice president at Goldman when he left the firm in 1990, as chief strategist, and Steve Mnuchin, who had spent 17 years at Goldman, as Treasury secretary. And there were more to come. A few weeks later, another Goldman partner, Dina Powell, joined the White House as a senior counselor for economic initiatives. Goldman was a longtime client of Jay Clayton, Trump’s choice to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission; Clayton had represented Goldman after the 2008 financial crisis, and his wife Gretchen worked there as a wealth management adviser. And there was the brief, colorful tenure of Anthony Scaramucci as White House communications director: Scaramucci had been a vice president at Goldman Sachs before leaving to co-found his own investment company.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Even before Scaramucci, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., had joked that enough Goldman alum were working for the Trump administration to open a branch office in the White House.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“There was a devastating financial crisis just over eight years ago,” Warren said. “Goldman Sachs was at the heart of that crisis. The idea that the president is now going to turn over the country’s economic policy to a senior Goldman executive turns my stomach.” Prior administrations often had one or two people from Goldman serving in top positions. George W. Bush at one point had three. At its peak, the Trump administration effectively had six.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Earlier this summer, Trump boasted about his team of economic advisers at a rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. “This is the president of Goldman Sachs. Smart,” Trump \u003ca href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/06/21/watch_live_president_trump_speaks_at_event_highlighting_agricultural_innovation_in_iowa.html\">said\u003c/a>. “Having him represent us! He went from massive paydays to peanuts.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Trump waved off anyone who might question his decision to rely on the very people he had demonized. “Somebody said, ‘Why did you appoint a rich person to be in charge of the economy?’ … I said: ‘Because that’s the kind of thinking we want.’” He needed “great, brilliant business minds &#8230; so the world doesn’t take advantage of us.” How else could he get the job done? “I love all people, rich or poor, but in those particular positions, I just don’t want a poor person.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“Does that make sense?” Trump asked. The crowd cheered.\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-bleed full-bleed width-auto' style='width: auto;'> \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/GettyImages-632475670_retouch-1505510217.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-146728\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/GettyImages-632475670_retouch-1505510217.jpg\" alt=\"WASHINGTON, DC - JANUARY 23:  Director of the National Economic Council Gary Cohn (L) and Senior Advisor Jared Kushner (R) listen to U.S. President Donald Trump deliver opening remarks during a meeting with business leaders in the Roosevelt Room at the White House January 23, 2017 in Washington, DC.

At the end of 2016, he owned some 900,000 shares of Goldman Sachs stock, a stake worth around $220 million on the day Trump announced his appointment. Plus, he’d sold a million more Goldman shares over the previous half-dozen years. In 2007 alone, the year of the big short, Goldman Sachs paid him nearly $73 million — more than the firm paid CEO Lloyd Blankfein. The disclosure forms Cohn filled out to join the administration indicate he owned assets valued at $252 million to $611 million. That may or may not include the $65 million parting gift Goldman’s board of directors gave him for “outstanding leadership” just days before Trump was sworn in.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Like anyone taking a top job in the Trump administration, Cohn was \u003ca href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/28/executive-order-ethics-commitments-executive-branch-appointees\">required\u003c/a> to sign a pledge vowing not to participate for the next two years in any matter “that is directly and substantially related to my former employer or former clients, including regulations and contracts.” But presidents have sometimes issued waivers to these requirements, and it is unclear whether the Trump administration is making such waivers public.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Sens. Warren and Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat from Wisconsin, sent Cohn a letter a few days later. They brought up the $65 million bonus and asked him to publicly recuse himself from any issue that could have a direct or “significant indirect” impact on his old firm. Cohn never responded to the letter, and if he has ever received a waiver, it has not been made available to the public or the Office of Government Ethics.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“Consistent with the Trump administration’s stringent ethics rules, Mr. Cohn will recuse himself from participating in any matter directly involving his former employer, Goldman Sachs,” White House spokesperson Natalie Strom said. “The White House will not comment further.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The White House declined requests to make Cohn available for an interview and declined to answer a detailed set of questions.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Cohn shared the podium with fellow Goldman alum Mnuchin (the two made partner there the same year) when the administration unveiled its new tax plan, one that, if the past is prelude, had the potential to save Goldman more than $1 billion a year in corporate taxes. The president had promised to “do a number” on financial reforms implemented after the 2008 subprime crisis, including one that threatened to cost Goldman several billion dollars a year in revenues. Under Cohn, the administration has introduced new rules easing initial public offerings — a Goldman Sachs specialty dating back to the start of the last century, when the firm handled the IPOs of Sears, Roebuck; F. W. Woolworth; and Studebaker. As Trump’s top economic policy adviser, Cohn can exert influence over regulatory agencies that have shaken billions in penalties and settlements out of Goldman Sachs in recent years. And his former colleagues inside Goldman’s Public Sector and Infrastructure group likely appreciate the Trump administration’s infrastructure plan, which is more or less exactly as Cohn first pitched it inside Trump Tower in November.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“It’s hard to see how Gary Cohn recusing himself would solve a lot of these conflicts because nearly every major decision of his job would have a significant impact, likely billions of dollars, on Goldman Sachs and its executives,” said Tyler Gellasch, an attorney and former Senate staffer who helped draft Dodd-Frank, the landmark financial reform law passed in the wake of the financial meltdown. “Goldman touches nearly every aspect of the economy, from selling U.S. treasuries to helping companies go public, and the National Economic Council advises on all of that.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In the wake of last month’s white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, Cohn confessed to the \u003ca href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b85beea2-8924-11e7-bf50-e1c239b45787\">Financial Times\u003c/a> that he has “come under enormous pressure both to resign and to remain.” But the man who the Washington Post has dubbed Trump’s “moderate voice” declared that neo-Nazis would not force “this Jew” to leave his job. “As a patriotic American, I am reluctant to leave my post as director of the National Economic Council,” Cohn told FT. “I feel a duty to fulfill my commitment to work on behalf of the American people.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Or at least a few of them. The Trump economic agenda, it turns out, is largely the Goldman agenda, one with the potential to deliver any number of gifts to the firm that made Cohn colossally rich. If Cohn stays, it will be to pursue an agenda of aggressive financial deregulation and massive corporate tax cuts — he seeks to slash rates by 57 percent — that would dramatically increase profits for large financial players like Goldman. It is an agenda as radical in its scope and impact as Bannon’s was.\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-bleed full-bleed width-auto' style='width: auto;'> \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/AP_766382431678-1505494383.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-146605\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/AP_766382431678-1505494383.jpg\" alt=\"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump holds up his book 'The Art of the Deal', given to him by a fan as he speaks during a campaign stop Saturday, Nov. 21, 2015 in Birmingham, Ala.

He talks of military schools and visits to construction sites with his father and wrote in “The Art of the Deal” that in the second grade, “I actually gave a teacher a black eye. I punched my music teacher because I didn’t think he knew anything about music and I almost got expelled.” Yet when the authors of the book “Trump Revealed: An American Journey of Ambition, Ego, Money, and Power” spoke to several of his childhood friends, none of them recalled the incident. Trump himself crumpled when asked about the incident during the 2016 campaign: “When I say ‘punch,’ when you’re that age, nobody punches very hard.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Gary Cohn, however, is the middle-class kid and self-made millionaire Trump imagines himself to be. It appears that Cohn actually did slug a grade-school teacher in the face. “I was being abused,” Cohn told author Malcolm Gladwell, who interviewed him for his book, “David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants,” back when Cohn was still president of Goldman Sachs. As a child, Cohn struggled with dyslexia, a reading disorder people didn’t understand much about when Cohn attended school in the 1970s in a suburb outside Cleveland. “You’re a 6- or 7- or 8-year-old-kid, and you’re in a public-school setting, and everyone thinks you’re an idiot,” Cohn confessed to Gladwell. “You’d try to get up every morning and say, today is going to be better, but after you do that a couple of years, you realize that today is going to be no different than yesterday.” One time when he was in the fourth grade, a teacher put him under her desk, rolled her chair close, and started kicking him, Cohn said. “I pushed the chair back, hit her in the face, and walked out.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While Trump’s father was a wealthy real estate developer, Cohn’s father was an electrician. When Trump sought to get into the casino business, his father loaned him $14 million. When Cohn couldn’t find a job after graduating from college, all his father could do was find him one selling aluminum siding. While Trump has the instincts of a reality show producer and an eye for spectacle, Cohn prefers to operate in the shadows.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But they likely recognize much of themselves in the other. Both Cohn and Trump are alpha males — men of action unlikely to be found holed up in an office reading through stacks of policy reports. In fact, neither seems to be much of a reader. Cohn told Gladwell it would take him roughly six hours to read just 22 pages; he ended his time with the author by wishing him luck on “your book I’m not going to read.” Both have a transactional view of politics. Trump switched his voter registration between Democratic, Republican, and independent seven times between 1999 and 2012. In the 2000s, his foundation gave $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation, and he contributed $4,700 to Hillary Clinton’s senatorial campaigns. He even bought and refurbished a golf course in Westchester County a few miles from the Clinton home, in part, Trump once admitted, to ingratiate himself with the Clintons. Cohn is a registered Democrat who has given at least $275,000 to Democrats over the years, including to the campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, but also around $250,000 to Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>There are also striking similarities in their business histories. Both have a knack for weathering scandals and setbacks and coming out on top. Trump has filed for bankruptcy four times, started a long list of failed businesses (casinos, an airline, a football team, a steak company), but managed, through his best-selling books and highly rated reality TV show, to recast himself as the world’s greatest businessman. During Cohn’s tenure as president, Goldman Sachs faced lawsuits and federal investigations that resulted in $9 billion in \u003ca href=\"http://violationtracker.goodjobsfirst.org/parent/goldman-sachs\">fines\u003c/a> for misconduct in the run-up to the subprime meltdown. Goldman not only survived but thrived, posting record profits — and Cohn was rewarded with handsome bonuses and a position at the top of the new administration.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Cohn’s path to the White House started with a tale of brass and bluster that would make Trump the salesman proud. Still in his 20s and stuck selling aluminum siding, Cohn made a play that would change his life. In the fall of 1982, while visiting the company’s home office on Long Island, he stole a day from work and headed to the U.S. commodities exchange in Manhattan, hoping to talk himself into a job. He overheard an important-looking man say he was heading to LaGuardia Airport; Cohn blurted out that he was headed there, too. He jumped into a cab with the man and, Cohn told Gladwell, who devoted six pages of “David and Goliath” to Cohn’s underdog rise, “I lied all the way to the airport.” The man confided to Cohn that his firm had just put him in charge of a market, options, that he knew little about. Cohn likely knew even less, but he assured his backseat companion that he could get him up to speed. Cohn then spent the weekend reading and re-reading a book called “Options as a Strategic Investment.” Within the week, he’d been hired as the man’s assistant.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Cohn soon learned enough to venture off on his own and established himself as an independent silver trader on the floor of the New York Commodities Exchange. In 1990, Goldman Sachs, arguably the most elite firm on Wall Street, offered him a job.\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-bleed full-bleed width-auto' style='width: auto;'> \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/GettyImages-174012149-1505494436.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-146606\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/GettyImages-174012149-1505494436.jpg\" alt=\"The Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. logo is displayed at the company's booth on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., on Friday, July 19, 2013.

Marcus Goldman, a Jewish immigrant from Germany, leased a cellar office next to a coal chute in 1869. There, in an office one block from Wall Street, he bought the bad debt of local businesses that needed quick cash. His son-in-law, Samuel Sachs, joined the firm in 1882. A generation later, in 1906, the firm made its first mark, arranging for the public sale of shares in Sears, Roebuck. Goldman Sachs’s influence over politics dates back at least to 1914. That year, Henry Goldman, the founder’s son, was invited to advise Woodrow Wilson’s administration about the creation of a central bank, mandated by the Federal Reserve Act, which had passed the previous year. Goldman Sachs men have played important roles in U.S. government ever since.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>There was the occasional scandal, such as Goldman Sachs’s role in the 1970 collapse of Penn Central railroad, then the largest corporate bankruptcy in U.S. history. Still, the firm built a reputation as a sober, elite partnership that served its clients ably. In 1979, when John Whitehead, a senior partner and co-chairman, set to paper what he called Goldman’s “Business Principles,” he began with the firm’s most cherished belief: The client’s interests come before all else.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Two years later, Goldman took a step that signaled the beginning of the end of that culture. In the fall of 1981, Goldman purchased J. Aron &amp; Co., a commodities trading firm. Some within the partnership were against the acquisition, worried over how profane, often crude, trading culture would mix with Goldman’s restrained, well-mannered way of doing business. “We were street fighters,” one former J. Aron partner told Fortune magazine in 2008.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The J. Aron team moved into the Goldman Sachs offices in lower Manhattan, but didn’t adopt its culture. Within a few years, it was producing well over $1 billion a year in profits. They were 300 employees inside a firm of 6,000, but were posting one-third of Goldman’s total profits. The cultural shift, it turned out, was moving in the other direction. J. Aron, according to a book by Charles D. Ellis, a former Goldman consultant, brought to Goldman “a trading culture that would become dominant in the firm.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Lloyd Blankfein, who ascended to chairman and CEO in in 2006, started his Goldman career at J. Aron, a year after Goldman acquired the firm. “We didn’t have the word ‘client’ or ‘customer’ at the old J. Aron,” Blankfein told \u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/2008/03/17/lloyd-blankfein-goldman-sachs/\">Fortune\u003c/a> magazine two years after taking over as CEO. “We had counter-parties.” Cohn joined J. Aron eight years after Blankfein did, in 1990. Four years later, Blankfein was put in charge of the firm’s Fixed Income, Currency, and Commodities division, which included J. Aron. Cohn, loyal and hard-working, with an instinct for connecting with people who can help him, became Blankfein’s “\u003ca href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703374104575337180461840038\">corporate problem solver\u003c/a>.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The emergence of “Bad Goldman” — and Cohn’s central role in that drama — is really the story of the rise of the traders inside the firm. “As trading came to be a bigger part of Wall Street, I noticed that the vision changed,” said Robert Kaplan, a former Goldman Sachs vice chairman, who left in 2006 after working at the firm for 23 years. “The leaders were saying the same words, but they started to change incentives away from the value-added vision and tilt more to making money first. If making money is your vision, what lengths will you not go?”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>At the height of the dot-com years, a debate raged within the firm. The firm underwrote dozens of technology IPOs, including Microsoft and Yahoo, in the 1980s and 1990s, minting an untold number of multimillionaires and the occasional billionaire. Some of the companies they were bringing public generated no profits at all, while Goldman was generating up to $3 billion in profits a year. It seemed inevitable that some within Goldman Sachs began to dream of jettisoning the Goldman’s century-old partnership structure and taking their firm public, too. Jon Corzine was running the firm then — he would later go into politics in the Goldman tradition, first as a U.S. senator and then as New Jersey governor — and was four-square in favor of going public. Corzine’s second in command, Henry Paulson — who would go on to serve as Treasury secretary — was against the idea. But Corzine ordered up a study that supported his view that remaining private stifled Goldman’s competitive opportunities and promoted Paulson to co-senior partner. Paulson soon got on board. In May 1999, Goldman sold $3.7 billion worth of shares in the company. At the end of the first day of trading, Corzine’s and Paulson’s stakes in the firm were each worth $205 million. Cohn’s and Mnuchin’s shares were each worth $112 million. And Blankfein ended up with $168 million in company stock.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Like any publicly traded company, there would now be pressure on Goldman Sachs to make its quarterly numbers and “maximize shareholder value.” Discarding the partner model also meant the loss of a valuable restraint on risk-taking and bad behavior. Under the old system, any losses or fines came out of the partners’ pockets. In the early 1990s, for example, the firm was involved in transactions with Robert Maxwell, a London-based media mogul who was accused of stealing hundreds of millions of pounds from his companies’ pension funds. The $253 million that Goldman Sachs paid to settle lawsuits brought by pension funds over its involvement was split among the firm’s 84 limited partners. Now any losses are paid by a publicly traded entity owned by shareholders, with no direct financial liability for the decision-makers themselves. In theory, Goldman could claw back bonuses in response to executives’ bad behavior. But in 2016, when Goldman paid over $5 billion to settle charges brought by the Justice Department that the firm misled customers in the sale of a subprime mortgage product during Cohn’s time overseeing that unit, the Goldman board declined to dock Cohn’s pay. Instead, the company \u003ca href=\"http://www.goldmansachs.com/s/2017-proxy-statement/HTML1/goldman_sachs-proxy2017_0061.htm\">awarded\u003c/a> him a $5.5 million cash bonus and another $12.6 million in company stock.\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-bleed full-bleed width-auto' style='width: auto;'> \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/GettyImages-94843217-1505494531.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-146608\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/GettyImages-94843217-1505494531.jpg\" alt=\"UNITED STATES - JUNE 16:  The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executives, from right, Gary Cohn, president and co-chief operating officer, Lloyd Blankfein, chairman and chief executive officer, and Jon Winkelreid, president and co-chief operating officer, appear in a 2006 annual report arranged for a photograph in New York, U.S., on Monday, June 16, 2008.

When Blankfein was made vice chairman in charge of the firm’s multibillion-dollar global commodities business and its equities division, Cohn took over as co-head of FICC, Blankfein’s previous position. That meant Cohn was overseeing not just J. Aron and the firm’s commodities business, but also its currency trades and bond sales. By the start of 2004, Blankfein was promoted to president and COO, and Cohn was named co-head of global securities. At that point, Cohn had authority over the mortgage-trading desk. Under Cohn, the firm aggressively moved into the subprime mortgage market, using Goldman’s own money and that of its customers to help stoke the housing bubble.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Goldman was already enabling subprime predators, such as Ameriquest and New Century Financial, by providing them with the cash infusions they needed to scale up their lending to individual home buyers. Cohn would steer the firm deeper into the subprime frenzy by setting up Goldman as a patron of some of these same mortgage originators. During his tenure, Goldman snapped up loans from New Century, Countrywide, and other notorious mortgage originators and bundled them into deals with opaque names, such as ABACUS and GSAMP. Under Cohn’s watchful eye, Goldman’s brokers then funneled slices to customers they sold on the wisdom of holding mortgage-backed securities in their portfolios.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>One such creation, GSAA Home Equity Trust 2006-2, illustrates Goldman’s disregard for the quality of loans it was buying and packaging into security deals. Created in early 2006, the investment vehicle was made up of more than $1 billion in home loans Goldman had bought from Ameriquest, one of the nation’s largest and most aggressive subprime lenders. By that point, the lender already had set aside \u003ca href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/21/business/ameriquest-to-pay-325-million-in-a-settlement-over-lending.html\">$325 million\u003c/a> to settle a probe by attorneys general and banking regulators in 49 states, who accused Ameriquest of misleading thousands of borrowers about the costs of their loans and falsifying home appraisals and other key documents. Yet GSAA Home Equity Trust 2006-2 was filled with Ameriquest loans made to more than 3,000 homeowners in Arizona, Illinois, Florida, and elsewhere. By the end of 2008, 65 percent of the roughly 1,400 borrowers whose loans remained in the deal were in default, had filed for bankruptcy, or had been targeted for foreclosure.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In just three years, Goldman Sachs had increased its trading volume by a factor of 50, which the \u003ca href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703374104575337180461840038\">Wall Street Journal\u003c/a> attributed to “Cohn’s successful push to rev up risk-taking and use of Goldman’s own capital to make a profit” — what the industry calls proprietary trading, or prop trading. The 2010 Journal article quoted Justin Gmelich, then the firm’s mortgage chief, who said of Cohn, “He reshaped the culture of the mortgage department into more of a trading environment.” In 2005, with Cohn overseeing the firm’s home loan desk, Goldman underwrote $103 billion in mortgage-backed securities and other more esoteric products, such as collateralized debt obligations, which often were priced based on giant pools of home loans. The following year, the firm underwrote deals worth $131 billion.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In 2006, CEO Henry Paulson left the firm to join George W. Bush’s cabinet as Treasury secretary. Blankfein, Cohn’s mentor and friend, took Paulson’s place. By tradition, Blankfein, a trader, should have elevated someone from the investment banking side to serve as his No. 2, so both sides of the firm would be represented in the top leadership. Instead he named Cohn, his long-time loyalist, and Jon Winkelried, who also had history on the trading side, as co-presidents and co-COOs. Winkelried, who had started at Goldman eight years before Cohn, had probably earned the right to hold those titles by himself. But Cohn had the advantage of his relationship with the CEO. Blankfein and Cohn vacationed together in the Caribbean and Mexico, owned homes near each other in the Hamptons, and their children attended the same school. Winkelreid was out in two years. The bromance between his fellow No. 2 and the top boss may have proved too much.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>With Blankfein and Cohn at the top, the transformation of Goldman Sachs was complete. By 2009, investment banking had \u003ca href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703594404575192352257108006\">shrunk\u003c/a> to barely 10 percent of the firm’s revenues. Richard Marin, a former executive at Bear Stearns, a Goldman competitor that wouldn’t survive the mortgage meltdown, saw Cohn as “the root of the problem.” Explained Marin, “When you become arrogant in a trading sense, you begin to think that everybody’s a counterparty, not a customer, not a client. And as a counterparty, you’re allowed to rip their face off.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-bleed full-bleed width-auto' style='width: auto;'> \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/GettyImages-86536728-1-1505494588.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-146609\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/GettyImages-86536728-1-1505494588.jpg\" alt=\"ANTIOCH, CA - MAY 07:  Weeds grow in the driveway of a foreclosed home May 7, 2009 in Antioch, California.

It was the fall of 2006 and, as Daniel Sparks, the Goldman partner overseeing the firm’s 400-person mortgage trading department, wrote in an email to several colleagues, “Subprime market getting hit hard.” The firm had lent millions to New Century, a mortgage lender dealing in the higher-risk subprime market. And now New Century was late on payments. Sparks could see that the wobbly housing market was having an impact on his department. For 10 consecutive trading days, his people had lost money. The dollar amounts were small to a behemoth like Goldman: between $5 million and $30 million a day. But the trend made Sparks jittery enough to share his concerns with the Goldman’s top executives: President Gary Cohn; David Viniar, the firm’s chief financial officer; and CEO Lloyd Blankfein.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Sparks, a Cohn protégé, was running the mortgage desk that his mentor, only a few years earlier, had built into a major profit center for the bank. In 2006 and 2007, a report by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations found, the two “maintained frequent, direct contact” as Goldman worked to jettison the billions in subprime loans it had on its book. “One of my jobs at the time was to make sure Gary and David and Lloyd knew what was going on,” Sparks told William Cohan, author of the 2011 \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Money-Power-Goldman-Sachs-World/dp/038552384X/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=\">book\u003c/a> “Money and Power: How Goldman Sachs Came to Rule the World\u003cem>.\u003c/em>” “They don’t like surprises.” Viniar \u003ca href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/19/business/19goldman.html\">summoned\u003c/a> around 20 traders and managers to a 30th floor conference room inside Goldman headquarters in lower Manhattan. It was there, on an unseasonably warm Thursday in December 2006, that the firm decided to initiate what people inside Goldman would eventually dub “the big short.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>One name tossed around during the three-hour meeting was that of John Paulson. Paulson (no relation to Goldman’s former CEO) would later attain infamy when it was revealed that his firm, Paulson &amp; Co., made roughly $15 billion betting against the mortgage market. (His \u003ca href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703574604574499740849179448\">personal take\u003c/a> was nearly $4 billion.) At that point, though, Paulson was a little-known hedge fund manager who crossed Goldman’s radar when he asked the firm to create a product that would allow him to take a “short position” on the real estate market — laying down bets that a large number of mortgage investments were going to plummet in value. Goldman sold Paulson what’s called a credit-default swap, essentially an insurance policy that would pay off if homeowners defaulted on their mortgages in large enough numbers. The firm would create several more swaps on his behalf in the intervening months. Eventually, as mortgage defaults began to mount, people inside Goldman Sachs came to see Paulson as more of a prophet than a patsy. Some sitting around the conference table that December day wanted to follow his lead.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“There will be big opportunities the next several months,” one Goldman manager at the meeting wrote enthusiastically in an email sent shortly after it ended. Sparks weighed in by email later that night. He wanted to make sure Goldman had enough “dry powder” — cash on hand — to be “ready for the good opportunities that are coming.” That Sunday, Sparks copied Cohn on an email reporting the firm’s progress on laying down short positions against mortgage-backed securities it had put together. The trading desk had already made $1.5 billion in short bets, “but still more work to do.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Cohn was a member of Goldman’s board of directors during this critical time and second in command of the bank. At that point, Cohn and Blankfein, along with the board and other top executives, had several options. They might have shared their concerns about the mortgage market in a filing with the SEC, which requires publicly traded companies to reveal “triggering events that accelerate or increase a direct financial obligation” or might cause “impairments” to the bottom line. They might have warned clients who had invested in mortgage-backed securities to consider extracting themselves before they suffered too much financial damage. At the very least, Goldman could have stopped peddling mortgage-backed securities that its own mortgage trading desk suspected might soon collapse in value.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Instead, Cohn and his colleagues decided to take care of Goldman Sachs.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Goldman would not have suffered the reputational damage that it did — or paid multiple billions in federal fines — if the firm, anticipating the impending crisis, had merely shorted the housing market in the hopes of making billions. That is what investment banks do: spot ways to make money that others don’t see. The money managers and traders featured in the film “The Big Short” did the same — and they were cast as brave contrarians. Yet unlike the investors featured in the film, Goldman had itself helped inflate the housing bubble — buying tens of billions of dollars in subprime mortgages over the previous several years for bundling into bonds they sold to investors. And unlike these investors, Goldman’s people were not warning anyone who would listen about the disaster about to hit. As federal investigations found, the firm, which still claims “our clients’ interests always come first” as a core principle, failed to disclose that its top people saw disaster in the very products its salespeople were continuing to hawk.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Goldman still held billions of mortgages on its books in December 2006 — mortgages that Cohn and other Goldman executives suspected would soon be worth much less than the firm had paid for them. So, while Cohn was overseeing one team inside Goldman Sachs preoccupied with implementing the big short, he was in regular contact with others scrambling to offload its subprime inventory. One Goldman trader described the mortgage-backed securities they were selling as “shitty.” Another complained in an email that they were being asked to “distribute junk that nobody was dumb enough to take first time around.” A December 28 email from Fabrice “Fabulous Fab” Tourre, a Goldman vice president later convicted of fraud, instructed traders to focus on less astute, “buy and hold” investors rather than “sophisticated hedge funds” that “will be on the same side of the trade as we will.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-bleed full-bleed width-auto' style='width: auto;'> \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/GettyImages-102551892-1505494640.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-146610\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/GettyImages-102551892-1505494640.jpg\" alt=\"Gary Cohn, president and chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., right, and Craig Broderick, managing director and head of credit, market and operational risk with Goldman Sachs, are sowrn in during a Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission hearing on the role of derivatives in the financial crisis in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Wednesday, June 30, 2010.

Gary was running the company.” While making his rounds, Cohn would sometimes hike a leg up on a trader’s desk, his crotch practically in the person’s face.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>At 6-foot- 2, bullet-headed and bald with a heavy jaw and a fighter’s face, Cohn cut a large figure inside Goldman. Profiles over the years would describe him as aggressive, abrasive, gruff, domineering — the firm’s “attack dog.” He was the missile Blankfein launched when he needed to deliver bad news or enforce discipline. Cohn embodied the new Goldman: the man who would run through a brick wall if it meant a big payoff for the bank.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>A Bloomberg profile described his typical day as 11 or 12 hours in the office, a bank-related dinner, then phone calls and emails until midnight. “The old adage that hard work will get you what you want is 100 percent true,” Cohn said in a 2009 commencement address at American University. “Work hard, ask questions, and take risk.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>There’s no record of how often Cohn visited his stomping grounds after hours in the early months of 2007, but emails reveal an executive demanding — and getting — regular updates. On February 7, one of the largest originators of subprime loans, HSBC, reported a greater than anticipated rise in troubled loans in its portfolio, and another, New Century, restated its earnings for the previous three quarters to “correct errors.” Sparks wrote an \u003ca href=\"https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Financial_Crisis/042710Exhibits.pdf?attempt=2\">email\u003c/a> to Cohn and others the next morning to reassure them that his team was closely monitoring the pricing of the company’s “scratch-and-dent book” and already had a handle on which loans were defaults and which could still be securitized and offloaded onto customers. An impatient Cohn sent a two-word \u003ca href=\"https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Financial_Crisis/042710Exhibits.pdf?attempt=2\">email\u003c/a> at 5 o’clock that evening: “Any update?” The next day, an internal memo circulated that listed dozens of mortgage-backed securities with the exhortation, “Let all of the respective desks know how we can be helpful in moving these bonds.” A week later, Sparks updated Cohn on the billions in shorts his firm had bought but warned that it was hurting sales of its “pipeline of CDOs,” the collateralized debt obligations the firm had created in order to sell the mortgages still on its books.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In early March, Cohn was among those who received an email spelling out the mortgage products the firm still held. The stockpile included $1.7 billion in mortgage-related securities, along with $1.3 billion in subprime home loans and $4.3 billion in “Alt-A” loans that fall between prime and subprime on the risk scale. Goldman was “net short,” according to that same email, with $13 billion in short positions, but its exposure to the mortgage market was still considerable. Sparks and others continued to update Cohn on their success offloading securities backed by subprime mortgages through the third quarter of 2007. One product Goldman priced at $94 a share on March 31, 2007 was worth just $15 five months later. Pension funds and insurance companies were among those losing billions of dollars on securities Goldman put together and endorsed as a safe, AAA-rated investments.\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-bleed full-bleed width-auto' style='width: auto;'> \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/GettyImages-78284727-1505494697.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-146611\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/GettyImages-78284727-1505494697.jpg\" alt=\"US Treasury Secretary Henry M.

A pair of Bear Stearns hedge funds failed. Merrill Lynch reported $2.2 billion in losses — its largest quarterly loss ever. Merrill’s CEO warned that the bank faced another $8 billion in potential losses due to the firm’s exposure to subprime mortgages and resigned several weeks later. The roiling credit crisis also took down the CEO of Citigroup, which reported $6.5 billion in losses and then weeks later, warned of $8 billion to $11 billion in additional subprime-related write-downs.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>And then there was Goldman Sachs, which reported a $2.9 billion profit that quarter. For the moment, the financial press seemed in awe of Blankfein, Cohn, and the rest of the team running the firm. Fortune headlined an article “How Goldman Sachs Defies Gravity” that said Goldman’s “huge, shrewd bet” against the mortgage market “would seem to confirm the view Goldman is the nimblest, and perhaps the smartest, brokerage on Wall Street.” A Goldman press release drily noted that “significant losses” in some areas — the subprime mortgages it hadn’t managed to unload — had been “more than offset by gains on short mortgage products.” A Goldman trader who played a central role in the big short was not so demure when making the case for a big bonus that year. John Paulson was “definitely the man in this space,” he conceded, but he’d helped make Goldman “#1 on the street by a wide margin.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Disaster struck nine months into 2008 with the collapse of Lehman Brothers, in large part the result of its exposure to subprime losses. Hank Paulson, the Treasury secretary and former Goldman CEO, spent a weekend meeting with would-be suitors willing to take over a storied bank that on paper was now worth virtually nothing. He couldn’t find a buyer. Nor could officials from the Federal Reserve, who were also working overtime to save the investment bank, founded in 1850, that was even older than Goldman Sachs. Shortly after midnight on Monday, September 15, 2008, Lehman announced that it would file for bankruptcy protection when the courts in New York opened that morning — the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Goldman Sachs wasn’t immune from the crisis. The week before Lehman’s fall, Goldman’s stock had topped $161 a share. By Wednesday, it dropped to below $100. It had avoided some big losses by betting against the mortgage market, but the wider financial crisis was wreaking havoc on its other investments. On paper, Cohn had personally lost tens of millions of dollars. He hunkered down in an office with a view of Goldman’s trading floor and worked the phone, trying to change the minds of major investors who were pulling their money from Goldman, fearful of anything riskier than stashing their cash in a mattress.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The next week, Goldman \u003ca href=\"https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2008/09/21/goldman-morgan-to-become-bank-holding-companies/comment-page-11/\">converted\u003c/a> from a free-standing investment bank to a bank holding company, which made it, in the eyes of regulators, no different from Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, or any other retail bank. That gave the firm access to cheap capital through the Fed but would also bring increased scrutiny from regulators. The bank took a $10 billion bailout from the Troubled Asset Relief Program and another $5 billion from Warren Buffett, in return for an annual dividend of 10 percent and access to discounted company stock. The firm raised additional billions through a public stock offering.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The biggest threat to Goldman was the economic health of the American International Group. Among other products, AIG sold insurance to protect against defaults on mortgage assets, which had been central to Goldman’s big short. Of the $80 billion in U.S. mortgage assets that AIG insured during the housing bubble, Goldman bought protection from AIG on roughly $33 billion, according to the Wall Street Journal. When Lehman went into bankruptcy, its creditors received 11 cents on the dollar. Executives at AIG, in a frantic effort to avoid bankruptcy, had floated the idea of pushing its creditors to accept 40 to 60 cents on the dollar; there was speculation creditors like Goldman would receive as little as 25 percent. Goldman and its clients were looking at multibillion-dollar hits to their bottom line — a potentially \u003ca href=\"http://fcic-static.law.stanford.edu/cdn_media/fcic-reports/fcic_final_report_full.pdf\">fatal\u003c/a> blow.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But as Goldman learned a century ago, it pays to have friends in high places. The day after Lehman went bankrupt, the Bush administration announced an $85 billion bailout of AIG in return for a majority stake in the company. The next day, Paulson obtained a waiver regarding interactions with his former firm because, the Treasury secretary said, “It became clear that we had some very significant issues with Goldman Sachs.” Paulson’s calendar, the New York Times reported, showed that the week of the AIG bailout, he and Blankfein spoke two dozen times. While creditors around the globe were being forced to settle for much less than they were owed, AIG paid its counterparties 100 cents on the dollar. AIG ended up being the single largest private recipient of TARP funding. It received additional billions in rescue funds from the New York Federal Reserve Bank, whose board chair Stephen Friedman was a former Goldman executive who still sat on the firm’s board. The U.S. Treasury ended up with greater than a 90 percent share of AIG, and the U.S. government, using taxpayer dollars, paid in full on the insurance policies financial institutions bought to protect themselves from steep declines in real estate prices — chief among them, Goldman Sachs. All told, Goldman received at least $22.9 billion in public bailouts, including $10 billion in TARP funds and $12.9 billion in taxpayer-funded payments from AIG.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Goldman, once again, had come out on top.\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-bleed full-bleed width-auto' style='width: auto;'> \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/GettyImages-458388665-1505494750.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-146612\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/GettyImages-458388665-1505494750.jpg\" alt=\"Goldman Sachs Group Inc. headquarters stands in New York, U.S., on Wednesday, Oct. 12, 2016.

Other banks in the U.S. and abroad were still struggling but not Goldman, which reported a record $19.8 billion in pre-tax profits that year, and $12.9 billion the next. Gary Cohn went without a bonus in 2008, left to scrape by on his $600,000 salary. Once free of government interference, the Goldman board (which included Cohn himself) \u003ca href=\"http://www.goldmansachs.com/investor-relations/financials/archived/proxy-statements/docs/2011-proxy-statement.pdf\">paid\u003c/a> him a $9 million bonus in 2009 and an $18 million bonus in 2010.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Yet the once venerated firm was now the subject of jokes on the late-night talk shows. David Letterman broadcast a “Goldman Sachs Top 10 Excuses” list (No. 9: “You’re saying ‘fraud’ like it’s a bad thing.”). Rolling Stone’s Matt Taibbi described the bank as “a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money,” a devastating moniker that followed Goldman into the business pages. After news leaked that the firm might pay its people a record $16.7 billion in bonuses in 2009, even President Barack Obama, for whom the firm had been a top campaign donor, began to turn against Goldman, telling “\u003ca href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB126073152465089651\">60 Minutes\u003c/a>,” “I did not run for office to be helping out a bunch of fat-cat bankers on Wall Street.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“They’re still puzzled why is it that people are mad at the banks,” Obama said. “Well, let’s see. You guys are drawing down $10, $20 million bonuses after America went through the worst economic year that it’s gone through in decades, and you guys caused the problem.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Goldman was also facing an onslaught of investigations and lawsuits over behavior that had helped precipitate the financial crisis. Class actions and other lawsuits filed by pension funds and other investors accused Goldman of abusing their trust, making “false and misleading statements,” and failing to conduct basic due diligence on the loans underlying the products it peddled. At least 25 of these suits named Cohn as a defendant.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>State and federal regulators joined the fray. The SEC accused Goldman of deception in its marketing of opaque investments called “synthetic collateralized debt obligations,” the values of which were tied to bundles of actual mortgages. These were the deals Goldman had arranged in 2006 on behalf of John Paulson so he could short the U.S. housing market. Goldman, it turned out, had allowed Paulson to cherry-pick poor-quality loans at the greatest risk of defaulting — a fact Goldman did not share with potential investors. “Goldman wrongly permitted a client that was betting against the mortgage market to heavily influence which mortgage securities to include in an investment portfolio,” the SEC’s enforcement director at the time said, “telling other investors that the securities were selected by an independent, objective third party.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Suddenly, Cohn and other Goldman officials were downplaying the big short. In June 2010, Cohn testified before the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, created by Congress to investigate the causes of the nation’s worst economic collapse since the Great Depression. Cohn asked the commissioners how anyone could claim the firm had bet against its clients when “during the two years of the financial crisis, Goldman Sachs lost $1.2 billion in its residential mortgage-related business”? His statement was technically true, but Cohn failed to mention the billions of dollars the firm pocketed by betting the mortgage market would collapse. Senate investigators later calculated that, at its peak, Goldman had $13.9 billion in short positions that would only pay off in the event of a steep drop in the mortgage market, positions that produced a record $3.7 billion in profits.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Two weeks after Cohn’s testimony, Goldman agreed to pay the SEC \u003ca href=\"https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2010/2010-123.htm\">$550 million\u003c/a> to settle charges of securities fraud — then the largest penalty assessed against a financial services firm in the agency’s history. Goldman admitted no wrongdoing, acknowledging only that its marketing materials “contained incomplete information.” Goldman paid $60 million in fines and restitution to settle an investigation by the \u003ca href=\"http://www.mass.gov/ago/news-and-updates/press-releases/2009/attorney-general-martha-coakley-and-goldman.html\">Massachusetts\u003c/a> attorney general into the financial backing the firm had offered to predatory mortgage lenders. The bank set aside another \u003ca href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20130116a.htm\">$330 million\u003c/a> to assist people who lost their homes thanks to questionable foreclosure practices at a Goldman loan-servicing subsidiary. Goldman agreed to billions of dollars in additional settlements with state and federal agencies relating to its sale of dicey mortgage-backed securities. The firm finally \u003ca href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/goldman-sachs-agrees-pay-more-5-billion-connection-its-sale-residential-mortgage-backed\">acknowledged\u003c/a> that it had failed to conduct basic due diligence on the loans its was selling customers and, once it became aware of the hazards, did not disclose them.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In the final report produced by the Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Goldman Sachs was mentioned an extraordinary 2,495 times, and Gary Cohn 89 times.

Even before the 2008 crash, the firm’s lobbying \u003ca href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?id=D000000085&amp;year=2017\">spending\u003c/a> had grown under Lloyd Blankfein and Cohn. By 2010, the year financial reforms were being drafted, Goldman \u003ca href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?id=D000000085&amp;year=2010\">spent\u003c/a> $4.6 million for the services of 49 lobbyists. Their ranks included some of the most well-connected figures in Washington, including Democrat Richard Gephardt, a former House majority leader, and Republican Trent Lott, a former Senate majority leader, who had stepped down from the Senate two years earlier.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Despite all those lobbyists on the payroll, Goldman made its case primarily through proxies during the debate over financial reform. “The name Goldman Sachs was so radioactive it worked to their disadvantage to be tied to an issue,” said Marcus Stanley, then a staffer for Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer and now policy director of Americans for Financial Reform. Instead, Goldman lobbied through industry groups.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Goldman’s people likely knew that all of Wall Street’s lobbying might could not stop the passage of the sprawling 2010 legislative package dubbed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Obama was putting his muscle behind reform — “We simply cannot accept a system in which hedge funds or private equity firms inside banks can place huge, risky bets that are subsidized by taxpayers,” he said in one \u003ca href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/7046668/Barack-Obamas-speech-on-banking-reform-in-full.html\">speech\u003c/a> — and the Democrats enjoyed majorities in both houses of Congress. “For Goldman Sachs, the battle was over the final language,” said Dennis Kelleher of Better Markets, a Washington, D.C., lobby group that pushes for tighter financial reforms. “That way they at least had a fighting chance in the next round, when everyone turned their attention to the regulators.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>There was a lot for Goldman Sachs to dislike about Dodd-Frank. There were small annoyances, such as “say on pay,” which ordered companies to give shareholders input on executive compensation, a source of potential embarrassment to a company that gave out $73 million in compensation for a single year’s work — as Goldman paid Cohn in 2007. There were large annoyances, such as the \u003ca href=\"https://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/fsoc/designations/Pages/default.aspx#FMU\">requirement\u003c/a> that financial institutions deemed too big to fail, like Goldman, create a wind-down plan in case of disaster. There were the measures that would interfere with Goldman’s core businesses, such as a provision instructing the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to regulate the trading of derivatives. And yet nothing mattered to Goldman quite like the Volcker Rule, which would protect banks’ solvency by limiting their freedom to make speculative trades with their own money. Unless Goldman could initiate what Stanley called the “complexity two-step” — win a carve-out so a new rule wouldn’t interfere with legitimate business and then use that carve-out to render a rule toothless — Volcker would slam the door shut on the entire direction in which Blankfein and Cohn had taken Goldman.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It was 5:30 a.m. on Friday, June 25, 2010, when a joint House-Senate conference committee \u003ca href=\"https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/111th-congress/house-report/517\">approved\u003c/a> the final language of Dodd-Frank. By Sunday, an industry attorney named Annette Nazareth — a former top SEC official whose firm counts Goldman Sachs among its clients — had already sent off a heavily annotated copy of the 848-page bill to colleagues at her old agency. It was just the first salvo in a lobbying juggernaut.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Within a few months, Cohn himself was in Washington to \u003ca href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/rr-commpublic/Goldman_Sachs_meeting_20101004.pdf\">meet\u003c/a> with a governor of the Federal Reserve, one of the key agencies charged with implementing Volcker. The visitors log at the CFTC, the agency Dodd-Frank put in charge of derivatives reform, shows that Cohn traveled to D.C. to personally meet with CFTC staffers at least six times between 2010 and 2016. Cohn also came to the capital for meetings at the SEC, another agency responsible for the Volcker Rule. There, he met with SEC chair Mary Jo White and other commissioners. “I seem to be in Washington every week trying to explain to them the unintended consequences of overregulation,” Cohn said in a talk he gave to business students at Sacred Heart University in 2015.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“Gary was the tip of the spear for Goldman to beat back regulatory reform,” said Kelleher, the financial reform lobbyist. “I used to pass him going into different agencies. They brought him in when they wanted the big gun to finish off, to kill the wounded.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Democrats lost their majority in the House that November, and Goldman threw its weight behind the spate of Republican bills that followed, aimed at taking apart Dodd-Frank piece by piece. Goldman spent more than $4 million for the services of 45 lobbyists in 2011 and $3.5 million a year in 2012 and 2013. Its lobbying spending was nearly as high in the years after passage of Dodd-Frank as it was the year the bill was introduced.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Goldman lobbyists dug in on a range of issues that would become top priorities for Republicans in the wake of Donald Trump’s electoral victory. Records from the Center for Responsive Politics show that Goldman lobbyists worked to promote corporate tax cuts, such as on the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 and Senate legislation aimed at extending some $200 billion in tax cuts for individuals and businesses. Goldman lobbied for a bill to fund economically critical infrastructure projects, presumably on behalf of its Public Sector and Infrastructure group. Goldman had seven lobbyists working on the JOBS Act, which would make it easier for companies to go public, another bottom-line issue to a company that underwrote $27 billion in IPOs last year. In 2016, Goldman had eight lobbyists dedicated to the Financial CHOICE Act, which would have undone most of Dodd-Frank in one fell swoop — a bill the House revived in April.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Yet defanging the Volcker Rule remained the firm’s top priority. Promoted by former Fed Chair Paul Volcker, the rule would prohibit banks from committing more than 3 percent of their core assets to in-house private equity and hedge funds in the business of buying up properties and businesses with the goal of selling them at a profit. One harbinger of the financial crisis had been the collapse in the summer of 2007 of a pair of Bear Stearns hedge funds that had invested heavily in subprime loans. That 3 percent cap would have had a big impact on Goldman, which maintained a separate private equity group and operated its own internal hedge funds. But it was the restrictions Volcker placed on proprietary trading that most threatened Goldman.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prop trading was a profit center inside many large banks, but nowhere was it as critical as at Goldman. A 2011 report by one Wall Street analyst revealed that prop trading accounted for an 8 percent share of JPMorgan Chase’s annual revenues, 9 percent of Bank of America’s, and 27 percent of Morgan Stanley’s. But prop trading made up 48 percent of Goldman’s. By one \u003ca href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-goldman-volcker-idUSTRE7434PZ20110505\">estimate\u003c/a>, the Volcker Rule could cost Goldman Sachs $3.7 billion in revenue a year.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>When regulators finalized a new Volcker Rule in 2013, Better Markets declared it a “major defeat for Wall Street.” Yet the victory for reformers was precarious. “Just changing a few words could dramatically change the scope of the rule — to the tune of billions of dollars for some firms,” said former Senate staffer Tyler Gellasch, who helped write the rule. Volcker gave banks until July 2015 — the five-year anniversary of Dodd-Frank — to bring themselves into compliance. Yet apparently the Volcker Rule had been written for other financial institutions, not elite firms like Goldman Sachs. “Goldman Sachs has been on a shopping spree with its own money,” began a New York Times article in January 2015. The bank used its own funds to buy a mall in Utah, apartments in Spain, and a European ink company. Paul Volcker expressed disappointment that banks were still making big proprietary bets, as did the two senators most responsible for writing the rule into law. That June, Cohn appeared to reassure investors that Goldman would find a workaround. Speaking at an investor conference, he said Goldman was “transforming our equity investing activities to continue to meet client needs while complying with Volcker.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Goldman had five years to prepare for some version of a Volcker Rule. Yet a loophole granted banks sufficient time to dispose of “illiquid assets” without causing undue harm — a loophole that might even cover the assets Goldman had only recently purchased, despite the impending compliance deadline. The Fed nonetheless granted the firm additional time to sell illiquid investments worth billions of dollars. “Goldman is brilliant at exercising access and influence without fingerprints,” Kelleher said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>By mid-2016, Goldman, along with Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase, was petitioning the Fed for an additional five years to comply with Volcker — which would take the banks well into a new administration. All Blankfein and Cohn had to do was wait for a new Congress and a new president who might back their efforts to flush all of Dodd-Frank. Then Goldman could continue the risky and lucrative habits it had adopted since traders like Cohn had taken over the firm — the financial crisis be damned — and continue raking in billions in profits each year.\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-bleed full-bleed width-auto' style='width: auto;'> \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/GettyImages-456025502-1505494804.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-146614\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/GettyImages-456025502-1505494804.jpg\" alt=\"Lloyd Blankfein, Chairman &amp; CEO, Goldman Sachs (L) stands on stage with former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during the 2014 Clinton Global Initiative annual meeting in New York September 24, 2014.

Dating back to at least 1990, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, people associated with the firm and its political action committees \u003ca href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/totals.php?id=d000000085&amp;cycle=2012\">contributed\u003c/a> more to Democrats than Republicans. Yet in the years since financial reform, Goldman, once Obama’s second-largest political donor, shifted its campaign contributions to Republicans. During the 2008 election cycle, for instance, Goldman’s people and PACs contributed $4.8 million to Democrats and $1.7 million to Republicans. By the 2012 cycle, the opposite happened, with Goldman giving $5.6 million to Republicans and $1.8 million to Democrats. Cohn’s personal giving followed the same path. Cohn gave $26,700 to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in 2006 and $55,500 during the 2008 election cycle, and none to its GOP equivalent. But Cohn donated $30,800 to the National Republican Senatorial Committee in 2012 and another $33,400 to the National Republican Congressional Committee in 2015, without contributing a dime to the DSCC. Cohn gave $5,000 to Massachusetts Republican Scott Brown weeks after news broke that Elizabeth Warren — an outspoken critic of Goldman and other Wall Street players — might try to capture his U.S. Senate seat, which she did in 2012.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Goldman Sachs, under Cohn and Blankfein, was hardly chastened, continuing to play fast and loose with existing rules even as it plunged millions of dollars into fending off new ones. In 2010, the SEC ran a sting operation looking for banks willing to trade favorable assessments by its stock analysts for a piece of a Toys R Us IPO if the company went public. Goldman took the bait, for which they would pay a $5 million fine. An employee working out of Goldman’s Boston office drafted speeches, vetted a running mate, and negotiated campaign contracts for the state treasurer during his run for Massachusetts governor in 2010, despite a rule forbidding municipal bond dealers from making significant political contributions to officials who can award them business. According to the SEC, Goldman had underwritten $9 billion in bonds for Massachusetts in the previous two years, generating $7.5 million in fees. Goldman paid $12 million to settle the matter in 2012.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Just two years later, Goldman officials were again summoned by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations to address charges that the bank under Cohn and Blankfein had boosted its profits by building a “virtual monopoly” in order to inflate aluminum prices by as much as $3 billion.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The last few years have brought more unwanted attention. In 2015, the U.S. Justice Department launched an investigation into Goldman’s role in the alleged theft of billions of dollars from a development fund the firm had helped create for the government of Malaysia. Federal regulators in New York state fined Goldman $50 million because its leaders failed to effectively supervise a banker who leaked stolen confidential government information from the Fed, which \u003ca href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/enforcement20160803a.htm\">hit the firm\u003c/a> with another $36.3 million in penalties. In December, the CFTC \u003ca href=\"http://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/pr7505-16\">fined\u003c/a> Goldman $120 million for trying to rig interest rates to profit the firm.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Politically, 2016 would prove a strange year for Goldman. Bernie Sanders clobbered Hillary Clinton for pocketing hundreds of thousands of dollars in speaking fees from Goldman, while Trump attacked Ted Cruz for being “in bed with” Goldman Sachs. (Cruz’s wife Heidi was a managing director in Goldman’s Houston office until she took leave to work on her husband’s presidential campaign.) Goldman would have “total control” over Clinton, Trump \u003ca href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/19/politics/donald-trump-ted-cruz-goldman-sachs/\">said\u003c/a> at a February 2016 rally, a point his campaign reinforced in a two-minute ad that ran the weekend before Election Day. An image of Blankfein flashed across the screen as Trump warned about the global forces that “robbed our working class.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Goldman’s giving in the presidential race appears to reflect polls predicting a Clinton win and the firm’s desire for a political restart on deregulation. People who identified themselves as Goldman Sachs employees \u003ca href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2017/03/revolving-door-goldman-sachs/\">gave less than $5,000\u003c/a> to the Trump campaign compared to the $341,000 that the firm’s people and PACs \u003ca href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.php?cycle=Career&amp;cid=n00000019\">contributed\u003c/a> to Clinton. Goldman Sachs is relatively small compared to retail banking giants.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Yet, according to the \u003ca href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2017/03/revolving-door-goldman-sachs/\">Center for Responsive Politics\u003c/a>, no bank outspent Goldman Sachs during the 2016 political cycle. Its PACs and people associated with the firm made $5.6 million in political contributions in 2015 and 2016. Even including all donations to Clinton, 62 percent of Goldman’s giving ended up in the coffers of Republican candidates, parties, or conservative outside groups.\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-bleed full-bleed width-auto' style='width: auto;'> \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/GettyImages-675487028-1505498812.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-146628\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/GettyImages-675487028-1505498812.jpg\" alt=\"WASHINGTON, DC - MAY 01:  (AFP-OUT) U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to community bankers as Director of the National Economic Council Gary Cohn (2nd R) and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus (R) listen druing an event at the Kennedy Garden of the White House May 1, 2017 in Washington, DC.

There’s the high regard the president holds for anyone who is rich — and the instant legitimacy Cohn conferred upon the administration within business circles. Cohn’s appointment reassured bond markets about the unpredictable new president and lent his administration credibility it lacked among Fortune 100 CEOs, none of whom had donated to his campaign. Ego may also have played a role. Goldman Sachs would never do business with Trump, the developer who resorted to foreign banks and second-tier lenders to bankroll his projects. Now Goldman’s president would be among those serving in his royal court.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Who can say precisely why Cohn, a Democrat, said yes when Trump asked him to be his top economic aide? No doubt Cohn has been asking himself that question in recent weeks. But he’d hit a ceiling at Goldman Sachs. In September 2015, Goldman announced that Blankfein had lymphoma, ramping up speculation that Cohn would take over the firm. Yet four months later, after undergoing chemotherapy, Blankfein was back in his office and plainly not going anywhere. Cohn was 56 years old when he was invited to Trump Tower. An influential job inside the White House meant a face-saving exit — and one offering a huge financial advantage.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Trump spoke of the great financial price Cohn paid to join him in the White House during his speech in Cedar Rapids. But something like the opposite was true. A huge amount of Cohn’s wealth was tied up in Goldman stock. By entering government, he could sell his stake in the firm to comply with federal ethics laws. That way he could diversify his holdings and avoid roughly $50 million in capital gains taxes —  at least until he sold the replacement assets.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>A job in the White House might also prove an outlet for his frustrations with politicians and regulators intent on reining in the worst impulses of Wall Street. Trump was Trump, but he had also vowed to dismantle financial reform. “Dodd-Frank has made it impossible for bankers to function,” Trump said during the campaign. The new president had the potential to serve as a vessel for Goldman’s corporate interests.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“Maybe the one thing that holds this administration together is a belief that markets know best, and the least regulation is the best regulation,” said Dennis Kelleher of Better Markets. “Goldman’s interests fit with that very nicely.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-bleed full-bleed width-auto' style='width: auto;'> \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/GettyImages-695306024-1505498862.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-146629\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/GettyImages-695306024-1505498862.jpg\" alt=\"WASHINGTON, DC - JUNE 12:  U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin testifies before the House Appropriations Committee's Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee in the Rayburn House Office Building on Capitol Hill June 12, 2017 in Washington, DC.

But taking over as Treasury secretary meant being confirmed by the Senate. Mnuchin’s confirmation vote was delayed after it was revealed that he’d neglected to list $95 million in assets (including homes in New York, Los Angeles, and the Hamptons) on his Senate Finance Committee disclosure forms and failed to disclose his ties to an offshore hedge fund registered in the Cayman Islands. Mnuchin was not confirmed until mid-February. The president’s pick for commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, a financier who had bailed out several of Trump’s casinos a few decades earlier, was not confirmed until the end of February.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>As a presidential aide, Cohn did not need Senate approval. He was part of the skeletal crew that arrived at the White House on day one, giving him a critical head start on wielding his clout and cultivating his relationship with the new president. At that point, Trump was summoning Cohn to the Oval Office for impromptu meetings as many as \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/11/business/dealbook/trump-economic-cabinet-gary-cohn.html?_r=0\">five times a day\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In early February, Trump signed an executive order giving his Treasury secretary 120 days to give him a hit list of regulations the administration could eliminate. But with Mnuchin yet to be confirmed, the task appeared to land in Cohn’s eager hands. He was standing at the president’s shoulder when Trump said, “We expect to be cutting a lot out of Dodd-Frank.” Shares in Goldman Sachs, which had jumped by 28 percent after the election, rose another $6 a share that day. Soon Cohn was coordinating Trump’s plans not only for rolling back regulations, but also for creating jobs and slashing taxes. He met with a health care specialist, along with House Speaker Paul Ryan and other Republican leaders, to discuss alternatives to the Affordable Care Act.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Proximity is power inside any White House, especially in this one, where policy often seems shaped by Trump’s last conversation. Treasury is several blocks away, while Cohn’s office was in the West Wing, directly across the hall from Bannon’s. Operating within a chaotic administration, Cohn was \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/11/business/dealbook/trump-economic-cabinet-gary-cohn.html?_r=0\">reportedly\u003c/a> energized and focused, working around the clock. Cohn is a tenacious practitioner who, after ascending to the heights of Goldman Sachs, could teach a master class on the art of seizing a leadership vacuum and building alliances. On day 39 of the new administration, the White House sent out a press release introducing the “best-in-class team” Cohn had assembled “to drive President Trump’s bold plan for job creation and economic growth.” The 13 advisers included familiar figures who had worked for George W. Bush or his father, but they also included at least three former lobbyists so conflicted they would need an ethics waiver to work in the White House. For instance, \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/15/us/politics/trump-appointees-potential-conflicts.html?mcubz=1&amp;_r=1\">Michael Catanzaro\u003c/a>, the man Cohn chose to oversee energy policy, was until last year a lobbyist for such oil, gas, and coal companies as Devon Energy and Talen Energy. Shahira Knight had been a lobbyist for Fidelity, the mutual fund giant, before joining Cohn’s team.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Cohn’s strategy in those early months was to make himself indispensable to the new president. Cohn emerged as one of the few people around Trump comfortable interrupting him during a meeting or openly disagreeing on points of policy. The New York Times reported that Trump often turned to Cohn during a meeting and asked him directly, “What do you want to do?” Early on, Trump referred to Cohn as “one of my geniuses” — a quote Reuters attributed to a “source close to Cohn.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Soon, major media were painting Cohn as a leading centrist inside the Trump White House because he had staked out positions on immigration, international alliances, and global warming at odds with Bannon’s hard-right nationalism. Bannon and his allies only bolstered this narrative by characterizing “Carbon Tax Cohn” and his allies, Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, as interlopers — “the Democrats,” as some inside the White House called them. “Within Trump’s Inner Circle, a Moderate Voice Captures the President’s Ear,” read the headline of a Cohn profile in the Washington Post.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“Led by Gary Cohn and Dina Powell — two former Goldman Sachs executives often aligned with Trump’s elder daughter and his son-in-law — the group and its broad network of allies are the targets of suspicion, loathing and jealousy from their more ideological West Wing colleagues,” the Washington Post reported. Fueling the rage of the ideologues, Cohn and his allies were largely winning. Trump dropped Bannon from the National Security Council and elevated Powell to deputy national security adviser. When, after Charlottesville, false reports leaked that Cohn was so disgusted with the president he was resigning, blue-chip stocks slid down. Instead, Bannon was out. Cohn, despite reports that he invoked Trump’s wrath for critical remarks to the Financial Times, was still in and expected to deliver the president a win on corporate taxes.\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-bleed full-bleed width-auto' style='width: auto;'> \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/GettyImages-678802232-1505498930.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-146631\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/GettyImages-678802232-1505498930.jpg\" alt=\"National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn arrives at a Wall Street Heliport while traveling with US President Donald Trump May 4, 2017 in New York, New York. / AFP PHOTO / Brendan Smialowski        (Photo credit should read BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images)\" />\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"caption overlayed\">National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn arrives at a Wall Street heliport while traveling with President Donald Trump on May 4, 2017 in New York City.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class='caption source pullright' style=''>Photo: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images\u003c/p>\u003c/div>\n\u003cp>On the day it was announced that he was joining the Trump administration, Cohn said on a goodbye podcast for Goldman Sachs, “You look at the size of our capital. You look at the size of our balance sheet. You look at the size of our people — it’s just enormous.” More than $40 billion had flowed into the bank in 2016, bringing the bank’s assets under management to a record $1.38 trillion. That meant pressure to find ways to put that money to work — an enormous challenge if regulators finally shut down Goldman’s prop trading arm.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>How exactly could Cohn recuse himself from matters involving Goldman when almost every aspect of his job has the potential to either grow Goldman’s profits and inflate its stock price — or tank them both?\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“To the extent Goldman Sachs is a direct party in a matter, Gary will recuse himself,” a source familiar with the situation said. But, the source added, “As NEC director, Gary is going to touch on matters on the day-to-day economy as a whole and Goldman Sachs is a participant in the economy, thus Gary will indirectly touch on things that affect Goldman Sachs along with other banks and institutions.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Yet rather than publicly recuse himself on attempts to undo Dodd-Frank, Cohn has led the charge from inside the White House. On that matter, Cohn is a walking, talking \u003ca href=\"https://www.oge.gov/web/oge.nsf/Financial+Conflicts+of+Interest\">conflict of interest\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While at Goldman, Cohn had personally met with officials at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to discuss the derivatives reform plank of Dodd-Frank, an arena in which Goldman is a dominant player. He had taken issue with rules imposed by Dodd-Frank that require banks to keep more capital on hand. Requiring banks to hold more money in reserve made them “unequivocally” safer than before 2008, he said in a 2015 interview while still Goldman’s president, but he complained that Goldman was now able to lend less money, hurting profits. And then there’s the Volcker Rule. Cohn, while still president of the firm, had traveled to D.C. at least twice to personally lobby regulators about its implementation.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>These days, it can be hard to tell whether Cohn is speaking as a high-ranking White House official or a former Goldman Sachs executive.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In the wake of Trump’s February call for a rollback in financial regulations, Cohn vowed in an interview with Bloomberg TV, “We’re going to attack \u003cem>all\u003c/em> aspects of Dodd-Frank.” The first example he gave: the Volcker Rule, which he cast as harmful to the country’s competitive advantage. In an \u003ca href=\"http://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/2017/02/03/dodd-frank-do-over-win-for-banks-trump-advisor-gary-cohn.html\">interview\u003c/a> that same day with Fox Business, he homed in on another Goldman obsession: Dodd-Frank’s capital requirements. “Banks are forced to hoard money because they are forced to hoard capital, and they can’t take any risks,” he said. Mortgage, auto, credit card lending, and commercial lending are all up since 2010. Yet Cohn told Fox viewers, “We need to get banks back in the lending business, that’s our No. 1 objective.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Roy Smith, a former Goldman partner now teaching at the NYU Stern School of Business, argues that Cohn should avoid the administration’s effort to unwind Dodd-Frank altogether, but “at a very minimum he has to excuse himself whenever the discussion turns to Volcker.” But Smith said he has trouble imagining Cohn leaving the room when Volcker comes up. “The hard part for someone like Cohn is that he knows where all the pain points are with Volcker and other parts of Dodd-Frank,” Smith said. “His every instinct would be to get involved.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Beyond deregulation, two other pillars of Trump’s economic plan — cutting taxes and investing in infrastructure — would have dramatic impacts on Goldman’s bottom line.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Thanks to loopholes, many Fortune 500 corporations pay \u003ca href=\"https://americansfortaxfairness.org/tax-fairness-briefing-booklet/fact-sheet-corporate-tax-rates/\">little or no\u003c/a> corporate income tax at all. By contrast, Goldman Sachs typically pays taxes near the official 35 percent federal tax rate. In 2014, for instance, Goldman paid $3.9 billion in taxes on profits of $12.4 billion, or 31 percent. Last year, the firm’s tax bill was $2.7 billion on profits of $10.3 billion, or 28 percent. In that same Fox Business interview, Cohn said that “lower corporate taxes” was the White House’s “starting point” on tax reform; cuts to personal income taxes were a secondary concern.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Under the plan Cohn and Mnuchin announced last spring, what Cohn called “one of the biggest tax cuts in the American history,” corporate taxes would be capped at 15 percent. If Cohn succeeds, Goldman will save massive sums: At that rate, Goldman would have paid $2 billion less in taxes in 2014, $1.4 billion less in 2015, and $1.4 billion less in 2016. The Koch brothers’ network of political groups has already spent millions of dollars to promote the proposal. Even Blankfein, who the Trump campaign singled out in the commercial it ran in the final days of the campaign, \u003ca href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-goldman-sachs-trump-idUSKBN1352KH\">acknowledged\u003c/a> in a voicemail to employees that Trump’s commitment to tax cuts, deregulation, and infrastructure “will be good for our clients and our firm.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The details of the president’s “$1 trillion” infrastructure plan are similarly favorable to Goldman. As laid out in the administration’s 2018 budget, the government would spend only $200 billion on infrastructure over the coming decade. By structuring “that funding to incentivize additional non-Federal funding” — tax breaks and deals that privatize roads, bridges, and airports — the government could take credit for “at least $1 trillion in total infrastructure spending,” the budget reads.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It was as if Cohn were still channeling his role as a leader of Goldman Sachs when, at the White House in May, he offered this advice to executives: “We say, ‘Hey, take a project you have right now, sell it off, privatize it, we know it will get maintained, and we’ll reward you for privatizing it.’” “The bigger the thing you privatize, the more money we’ll give you,” \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/trump-advisers-call-for-selling-off-old-assets-to-build-new-infrastructure/2017/05/23/657aa2c6-2f53-11e7-9534-00e4656c22aa_story.html?utm_term=.973cbdc4eb53\">continued\u003c/a> Cohn. By “we,” he clearly meant the federal government; by “you,” he appeared to be speaking, at least in part, about Goldman Sachs, whose Public Sector and Infrastructure group \u003ca href=\"http://www.goldmansachs.com/what-we-do/investment-banking/industry-sectors/municipal-finance/\">arranges\u003c/a> the financing on large-scale public sector deals. “Goldman Sachs is one of the largest infrastructure fund managers globally,” according to infrastructure advisory firm \u003ca href=\"http://www.infrapppworld.com/company/goldman-sachs-infrastructure-partners-gsip\">InfraPPP Partners\u003c/a>, “having raised more than $10 billion of capital since the inception of the business in 2006.” Lost in the infamous press conference the president gave in the lobby of Trump Tower a few days after Charlottesville, with Cohn and Mnuchin visibly uncomfortable at his right flank, were Trump’s remarks on infrastructure, the ostensible purpose of the event. The thrust was that the president would grease the wheels for project approvals by signing an executive order rolling back environmental impact requirements and other elements of an “overregulated permitting process.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In countless other ways, Cohn is positioned to help the firm that has been so good to him over the years. The country’s National Economic Council adviser might caution a president against running too large a deficit, especially amid a healthy economy. But Goldman Sachs is in the business of finding investors to underwrite government debt. An economic adviser might caution a populist president that corporate inversions often cost jobs and tax revenue. Instead, Trump has ordered a review of policies Obama put in place to discourage them — good news for Cohn’s former colleagues. Transparency has been a watchword of initial public offerings dating back at least to the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, but easing those rules, a step Goldman has sought, could potentially generate hundreds of millions of dollars in fees for investment banks such as Goldman. The SEC announced in June that it would allow any company going public to withhold details of its finances and strategies, an exemption previously available only to firms with under $1 billion in revenue — more good tidings for Goldman. Just loosening the rules for IPOs, said Tyler Gellasch, the former Senate staffer, “could mean hundreds of millions of dollars more to Goldman.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In June, the Treasury Department released a statement of principles about the administration’s approach to financial regulation focused on promoting “liquid and vibrant markets.” Not surprisingly, the report included a call to ease capital requirements and substantially amend the Volcker Rule.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It’s Cohn’s influence over the country’s regulators that worries Dennis Kelleher, the financial reform lobbyist. “To him, what’s good for Wall Street is good for the economy,” Kelleher said of Cohn. “Maybe that makes sense when a guy has spent 26 years at Goldman, a company who has repaid his loyalties and sweat with a net worth in the hundreds of millions.” Kelleher recalls those who lost a home or a chunk of their retirement savings during a financial crisis that Cohn helped precipitate. “They’re still suffering,” he said. “Yet now Cohn’s in charge of the economy and talking about eliminating financial reform and basically putting the country back to where it was in 2005, as if 2008 didn’t happen. I’ve started the countdown clock to the next financial crash, which will make the last one look mild.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>This article was reported in partnership with The Investigative Fund at The Nation Institute.\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"caption\">Top photo: National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn and U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin (R) take questions about tax cuts and reform during a briefing at the White House on April 26, 2017 in Washington, D.C.\u003c/p>\n","credit_additional_reporting":"","credit_additional_reporting_users_object":"","credit_photo_illustration":"","credit_research":"","credit_research_users_object":"","credit_translation":"","credit_translation_users_object":"","date":"2017-09-17T12:00:34+00:00","date_local":"2017-09-17T08:00:34+00:00","documents":"","excerpt":"At Goldman Sachs, Gary Cohn nearly wrecked the economy.

Under that law, nobody who is found possessing or using narcotics is arrested in Portugal, nor are they turned into a criminal. Indeed, neither drug use nor possession is considered a crime at all. Instead, those found doing it are sent to speak with a panel of drug counsellors and therapists, where they are offered treatment options.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">Seven years after the law was enacted, in 2008, we traveled to Lisbon to study the effects of that law for one of the first comprehensive reports on this policy, the findings of which were published \u003ca href=\"https://www.cato.org/publications/white-paper/drug-decriminalization-portugal-lessons-creating-fair-successful-drug-policies\">in a report\u003c/a> for the Cato Institute. The results were clear and stunning: This radical change in drug laws was a fundamental and undeniable success. \u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">While Portugal throughout the 1990s was (like most Western countries) drowning in drug overdoses along with drug-related violence and diseases, the country rose to the top of the charts in virtually all categories after it stopped prosecuting drug users and treating them like criminals. This stood in stark contrast to countries that continued to follow a harsh criminalization approach: the more they arrested addicts and waged a “war on drugs,” the more their drug problems worsened.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">With all the money that had been wasted in Portugal to prosecute and imprison drug users now freed up for treatment programs, and the government viewed with trust rather than fear, previously hopeless addicts transformed into success stories of stability and health, and the government’s anti-drug messages were heeded. The predicted rise in drug usage rates never happened; in some key demographic categories, usage actually declined. As the 2009 study concluded: “The data show that, judged by virtually every metric, the Portuguese decriminalization framework has been a resounding success.”\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cblockquote class='stylized pull-none'>&#8220;The data show that, judged by virtually every metric, the Portuguese decriminalization framework has been a resounding success.&#8221;\u003c/blockquote>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">Over the weekend, New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof, writing from Lisbon, \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/22/opinion/sunday/portugal-drug-decriminalization.html?mcubz=3\">re-visited this data\u003c/a>, now even more ample and conclusive than it was back in 2009. His conclusions were even more stark than the Cato report of eight years ago: namely, Portugal has definitively won the argument on how ineffective, irrational, and counterproductive drug prohibition is. \u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">The basis for this conclusion: Portugal’s clear success with decriminalization, compared to the tragic failures of countries, such as the U.S. (and Brazil), which continue to treat addiction as a criminal and moral problem rather than a health problem. Kristof writes:\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cblockquote>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\"> After more than 15 years, it’s clear which approach worked better. The United States drug policy failed spectacularly, with about as many Americans dying last year of overdoses — around 64,000 — as were killed in the Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq Wars combined.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\"> In contrast, Portugal may be winning the war on drugs — by ending it.

Therefore, we must eliminate drugs. Therefore, the more problems we have from drugs, the more aggressively we rid society of drugs and those who sell and use them.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">But this mentality is based on an obvious, tragic fallacy: namely, that the war on drugs, and drug criminalization, will eliminate drugs or at least reduce its availability. Decades of failure prove this will not happen; rather, the opposite will occur. Like the U.S., Brazil has imprisoned hundreds of thousands of citizens for drug-related crimes &#8212; mostly poor and nonwhite &#8212; and the problem has only worsened. Any person with minimal rationality would be forced to admit this string of logic is false.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">Supporting a failed policy by hoping that, one day, it will magically succeed, is the definition of irrationality. In the case of drug laws &#8212; which spawn misery and suffering &#8212; it is not only irrational but cruel. \u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">A \u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/02/war-on-drugs-not-working\">2011 report\u003c/a> from the Global Commission on Drug Policy &#8212; featuring multiple world leaders including former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and former Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso &#8212; examined all relevant evidence and put it simply: “The global war on drugs has failed, with devastating consequences for individuals and societies around the world.”\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">The primary fact in this conclusion is vitally important. The key cause of all drug-related pathologies &#8212; particularly gang violence of the type now suffocating Rocinha &#8212; is not drugs themselves, but rather the policy of criminalizing drugs and the war waged in its name.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/EMD_6775-1506434215.jpg\">\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-center  width-fixed' style='width: 1024px;'> \u003c/a>\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/EMD_6775-1506434215.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-148485\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/EMD_6775-1506434215-1024x684.jpg\" alt=\"EMD_6775-1506434215\" />\u003c/a>\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/EMD_6775-1506434215.jpg\"> \u003cp class='caption source' style=''>Photo: Erick Dau/The Intercept Brasil\u003c/p>\u003c/div>\u003cbr />\n\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">\u003cu>The nature of\u003c/u> drugs &#8212; their small size, the ease of smuggling, the natural demand humans have for them &#8212; means they can never be eliminated or meaningfully reduced by force. Only changes in human behavior, which can happen with sustained and professional treatment, can foster those improvements. The only effect of drug criminalization, beyond the massive human and financial waste of imprisoning addicts, is to empower and enrich drug gangs by ensuring that the profits from selling an illegal product remain irresistibly high.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">For that reason, the most devoted opponents of drug legalization or decriminalization are drug gangs themselves. Nothing would erase the power of drug gangs &#8212; such as the ones violently battling for control of Rocinha &#8212; more quickly or severely than the elimination of drug prohibition. As adept businesspeople, drug traffickers know that very well.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cblockquote class='stylized pull-none'>&#8220;The most devoted opponents of drug legalization or decriminalization are drug gangs themselves.&#8221;\u003c/blockquote>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">In 2016, the journalist Johann Hari, author of one of the most influential books on drug addiction, \u003ca href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/johann-hari/the-only-thing-drug-gangs_b_695264.html\">wrote an article\u003c/a> in The Huffington Post titled: “The Only Thing Drug Gangs and Cartels Fear Is Legalization.” As he put it:\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cblockquote>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\"> When you criminalize a drug for which there is a large market, it doesn’t disappear. The trade is simply transferred from off-licenses, pharmacists and doctors to armed criminal gangs. In order to protect their patch and their supply routes, these gangs tool up — and kill anyone who gets in their way. You can see this any day on the streets of a poor part of London or Los Angeles, where teenage gangs stab or shoot each other for control of the 3000 percent profit margins on offer.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003c/blockquote>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">We have a perfect historical analogy that proves this point: alcohol prohibition in the U.S. in the 1920s. When alcohol was made illegal, it did not disappear. Control of its sale and distribution simply shifted: from the corner grocery story to violent drug gangs of the type that Al Capone became famous for ruling. \u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">In other words, making alcohol illegal did not stop people from consuming it. What it did do, though, was empower vicious gangs of organized crime for whom the massive profits of selling illegal alcohol made them willing to do anything, or kill anyone, to protect it.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">What finally eliminated those violent prohibition gangs was not the police or the imprisonment of illegal dealers or alcoholics: During prohibition, when the gangs were’t bribing the police, they were killing them. What eliminated those gangs was the re-legalization of alcohol: by regulating the sale of alcohol, the end of prohibition made the gangs irrelevant, and they thus disappeared. \u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">Violent drug gangs do not fear the war on drugs; to the contrary, as Hari notes, they crave it. It is the criminalization of drugs that makes their trade so profitable. Hari quotes a long-time drug enforcement official in the U.S. as relating: “On one undercover tape-recorded conversation, a top cartel chief, Jorge Roman, expressed his gratitude for the drug war, calling it ‘a sham put on the American tax-payer’ that was ‘actually good for business.’”\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-right  width-fixed' style='width: 540px;'> \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/allen-1506433928.png\">\u003cimg class=\"alignright size-article-medium wp-image-148480\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/allen-1506433928-540x517.png\" alt=\"\" />\u003c/a> \u003c/div>In 2015, Danielle Allen, a political theorist at Harvard University, wrote \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/how-the-war-on-drugs-creates-violence/2015/10/16/6de57a76-72b7-11e5-9cbb-790369643cf9_story.html?utm_term=.e28c412d5606\">an op-ed in the Washington Post\u003c/a> titled “How the war on drugs creates violence.” In it, she explained that one key reason to “decriminalize drugs flows from how the war on drugs drives violent crime, which in turn pushes up incarceration and generates other negative social outcomes.” As she explained: “You just can’t move $100 billion worth of illegal product without a lot of assault and homicide.

Why can an influential Brazilian politician, linked to some of the most powerful figures in the country, employ a pilot who was \u003ca href=\"http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=11163376\">caught transporting millions of dollars in cocaine in a helicopter\u003c/a> owned by the politician, with no consequences for anyone? \u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">The answer is clear: because laws that outlaw drugs ensure that the drug trade is extremely profitable, which in turn ensures that gangs of organized criminals will arm themselves, and will kill, in order to control it. Situated in the middle of Zona Sul with easy exits, Rocinha will inevitably be a drug haven for rich tourists, middle-class professionals, and impoverished addicts. The vast sums of profits created by the war on drugs ensure that police forces will not only be out-armed but also so corrupted that their efforts will inevitably fail.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">It is now undeniably clear that it is the war on drugs itself which is what causes &#8212; not stops &#8212; drug-related violence.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">If you’re horrified by the violence in Rocinha or places around the world like it, the last thing you should do is support more policies that fuel the violence: namely, criminalization and the war on drugs. To do so is like protesting lung cancer by encouraging people to smoke. The data is now sufficient to state confidently: those who support ongoing drug criminalization are the ones abetting this drug violence and the related problems of addiction and overdose.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">It may be slightly paradoxical at first glance, but the data leaves no doubt: The only way to avoid Rocinha-style violence is through full drug decriminalization. We no longer need to speculate about this. Thanks to Portugal, the results are in, and they could not be clearer.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cem>David Miranda is the husband of Intercept co-founder Glenn Greenwald and a city councilmember for Rio de Janeiro (PSOL).\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n","credit_additional_reporting":"","credit_additional_reporting_users_object":"","credit_photo_illustration":"","credit_research":"","credit_research_users_object":"","credit_translation":"","credit_translation_users_object":"","date":"2017-09-26T14:20:37+00:00","date_local":"2017-09-26T10:20:37+00:00","documents":"","excerpt":"The only way to stop drug violence and other drug-related pathologies is by ending drug criminalization.","excerpt_type":"default","feature_header_background_color":"","feature_header_color":"","feature_header_layout":"default","feature_image_mask":"normal","feature_interactive_url":"","feature_text_color":"","feature_title":"Featured News","featured_video_url":"","hide_featured_image":false,"inline_featured_image":false,"is_banner_hidden":false,"is_feature":"0","language":{"code":"en","name":"English","slug":"english"},"language_related_post_ids":"148469","language_related_post_permalinks":["https://theintercept.com/2017/09/26/a-unica-solucao-para-a-violencia-como-na-rocinha-e-a-descriminalizacao/"],"layout":"default","link":"https://theintercept.com/2017/09/26/brazils-latest-outbreak-of-drug-gang-violence-highlights-the-real-culprit-the-war-on-drugs/","meta":{"links":[]},"mobile_thumbnail":null,"partner_feeds":[{"name":"Spoken Layer","slug":"spoken-layer"},{"name":"Uproxx","slug":"uproxx"}],"partnership":{"article_logo":"","article_logo_blurb":"In partnership with","article_text_color":"#AAAAAA","homepage_background_color":"#EEEEEE","homepage_featured":"0","homepage_logo":"","homepage_logo_blurb":"In partnership with","homepage_text_color":"#111111","module_type":"default","partner":"default","partner_url":"","video_module_post_description":"","video_module_post_image":"","video_module_post_title":""},"post_type":"post","related_post_ids":"148068","related_post_permalinks":["https://theintercept.com/2017/09/25/rocinha-favela-rio-de-janeiro-violence/"],"series":"","series_part_number":"","share_twitter_text":"Brazil’s outbreak of drug gang warfare highlights the real culprit: the war on drugs","show_donations_promo":true,"show_in_recirculation":true,"slug":"brazils-latest-outbreak-of-drug-gang-violence-highlights-the-real-culprit-the-war-on-drugs","thumbnail":{"ID":148477,"alt_text":"","content":"","credit":"Photo: Erick Dau/The Intercept Brasil","excerpt":"","sizes":{"article_header":{"height":720,"path":"wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/EMD_6866-1506433619-article-header.jpg","width":1440},"feature_hero":{"height":800,"path":"wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/EMD_6866-1506433619-feature-hero.jpg","width":1200},"original":{"height":"2003","path":"wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/EMD_6866-1506433619.jpg","width":"3000"},"promo":{"height":220,"path":"wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/EMD_6866-1506433619-promo.jpg","width":440},"promo_large":{"height":450,"path":"wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/EMD_6866-1506433619-promo-large.jpg","width":900},"small":{"height":133,"path":"wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/EMD_6866-1506433619-small.jpg","width":200},"square":{"height":440,"path":"wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/EMD_6866-1506433619-440x440.jpg","width":440},"top_large":{"height":440,"path":"wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/EMD_6866-1506433619-top-large.jpg","width":440},"top_small":{"height":200,"path":"wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/EMD_6866-1506433619-top-small.jpg","width":200}},"title":"EMD_6866-1506433619"},"title":"Brazil’s Latest Outbreak of Drug Gang Violence Highlights the Real Culprit: the War on Drugs","yoast_wpseo_canonical":"https://theintercept.com/2017/09/26/brazils-latest-outbreak-of-drug-gang-violence-highlights-the-real-culprit-the-war-on-drugs/","yoast_wpseo_facebook_description":"","yoast_wpseo_facebook_thumbnail":"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/09/EMD_6866-1506433619.jpg","yoast_wpseo_facebook_title":"","yoast_wpseo_general_description":"Glenn Greenwald and David Miranda: The success of drug decriminalization in Portugal shows more urgently than ever that the war on drugs doesn't work.","yoast_wpseo_general_title":"Brazil Must Decriminalize Drugs to Stop Gang Violence","yoast_wpseo_robots":"index, follow","yoast_wpseo_twitter_description":"","yoast_wpseo_twitter_thumbnail":"","yoast_wpseo_twitter_title":""},"149054":{"ID":149054,"article_length_type":"Medium","authors":[{"ID":7,"brief_bio":"Glenn Greenwald is a journalist, constitutional lawyer, and author of four \u003cem>New York Times\u003c/em> best-selling books on politics and law.","disable_staff_detail":false,"display_name":"Glenn Greenwald","email":"glenn.greenwald@theintercept.com","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/glenn.greenwald.5","full_bio":"\u003cp>Glenn Greenwald is one of three co-founding editors of The Intercept.

I \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/07/17/with-new-d-c-policy-group-dems-continue-to-rehabilitate-and-unify-with-bush-era-neocons/\">reported on the founding of this group\u003c/a>, calling itself the Alliance for Securing Democracy, when it was unveiled (this is not to be confused with the latest new Russia group \u003ca href=\"http://variety.com/2017/politics/news/rob-reiner-david-frum-committee-to-investigate-russia-1202563293/\">unveiled last week\u003c/a> by Rob Reiner and David Frum and featuring a different former national security state official (former DNI James Clapper) &#8211; calling itself InvestigateRussia.org &#8211; featuring a video declaring that the U.S. is now &#8220;at war with Russia&#8221;).\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The Kristol/Morell/Chertoff group on which the Times based its article has a very simple tactic: they secretly decide which Twitter accounts are &#8220;Russia bots,&#8221; meaning accounts that disseminate an &#8220;anti-American message&#8221; and are controlled by the Kremlin. They \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/913380227514019840\">refuse to tell anyone\u003c/a> which Twitter accounts they decided are Kremlin-loyal, nor will they identify their methodology for creating their lists or determining what constitutes &#8220;anti-Americanism.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>They do it all in secret, and you&#8217;re just supposed to trust them: Bill Kristol, Mike Chertoff and their national security state friends. And the New York Times is apparently fine with this demand, as evidenced by its uncritical acceptance yesterday of the claims of this group &#8211; a group formed by the nation&#8217;s least trustworthy sources.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But no matter. It&#8217;s a claim about nefarious Russian control. So it&#8217;s instantly vested with credibility and authority, published by leading news outlets, and then blindly accepted as fact in most elite circles. From now on, it will simply be Fact &#8211; based on the New York Times article &#8211; that the Kremlin aggressively and effectively weaponized Twitter to manipulate public opinion and sow divisions during the election, even though the evidence for this new story is the secret, unverifiable assertions of a group filled with the most craven neocons and national security state liars.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>That&#8217;s how the Russia narrative is constantly &#8220;reported,&#8221; and it&#8217;s the reason so many of the biggest stories have embarrassingly collapsed. It&#8217;s because the Russia story of 2017 &#8211; not unlike the Iraq discourse of 2002 &#8211; is now driven by religious-like faith rather than rational faculties.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>No questioning of official claims is allowed. The evidentiary threshold which an assertion must overcome before being accepted is so low as to be non-existent. And the penalty for desiring to \u003cem>see evidence\u003c/em> for official claims, or questioning the validity and persuasiveness of the evidence that is proffered, are accusations that impugn one&#8217;s patriotism and loyalty (simply wanting to see evidence for official claims about Russia is proof, in many quarters, that one is a Kremlin agent or at least adores Putin &#8211; just as wanting to see evidence in 2002, or questioning the evidence presented for claims about Saddam, was viewed as proof that one harbored sympathy for the Iraqi dictator).\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Regardless of your views on Russia, Trump and the rest, nobody can possibly regard this climate as healthy. Just look at how many major, incredibly inflammatory stories, from major media outlets, have collapsed. Is it not clear that there is something very wrong with how we are discussing and reporting on relations between these two nuclear-armed powers?\u003c/p>\n","credit_additional_reporting":"","credit_additional_reporting_users_object":"","credit_photo_illustration":"","credit_research":"","credit_research_users_object":"","credit_translation":"","credit_translation_users_object":"","date":"2017-09-28T15:48:06+00:00","date_local":"2017-09-28T11:48:06+00:00","documents":"","excerpt":"Now we have the \"Russia-hacked-the-voting-systems-of-21-states\" to add to this trash heap of debunked official claims.

Instead, the emails detail the evolution of ICE’s public statements once it became obvious that the Trump administration’s narrative was not true.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Bob Libal, executive director of Grassroots Leadership, an Austin-based civil rights group, said the emails show just “how aggressive and desperate and duplicitous ICE was during these raids.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“Essentially this is ICE trying to gin up a case for its actions, when really this isn’t at all about public safety,” he told The Intercept after reviewing the correspondence. “We can thoroughly expect that’s what they’re going to try to do again.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>ICE declined to comment for this article.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Starting on February 6, ICE conducted a nationwide sweep of undocumented immigrants in large and small cities across the country, quickly disseminating panic in immigrant communities. The raids — which led to \u003ca href=\"https://www.ice.gov/doclib/news/library/factsheets/pdf/factsheet-fugops.pdf\">680 arrests\u003c/a> nationwide — were the first in an ongoing series of mass enforcement operations ordered by the Trump administration. Last week, \u003ca href=\"https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/ice-arrests-over-450-federal-immigration-charges-during-operation-%E2%80%98safe-city%E2%80%99\">more than 450\u003c/a> people were arrested in a similar sweep the agency dubbed “Operation Safe City.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>At first, immigration officials said they were targeting public safety threats, such as individuals with criminal convictions and gang members. But while they sought to depict those swept up in the raids as dangerous criminals, it immediately became clear that many had only minor violations on their record, and that dozens had no criminal record at all. In Austin, where 51 people were arrested during the February raids, \u003ca href=\"http://www.statesman.com/news/austin-for-non-criminals-arrested-ice-raids/R8suKsN9kUIjnpz10S2DII/\">more than half\u003c/a> had no criminal convictions. Many of those who did have criminal records were found guilty of drunken driving.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Within hours, stories of ICE’s aggressive tactics dominated the media, as Austin residents reported that agents had set up checkpoints on the street, detained a teenager, and mistakenly apprehended a legal resident with no criminal history as he dropped his kids off at school. As anxiety over the raids escalated, elected officials issued public condemnations, and local and national reporters inundated the agency’s Texas offices with requests for comment.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In their first media responses, ICE officials maintained the line that the raids were in the public interest, telling reporters that “by removing from the streets criminal aliens and other threats to the public, ICE helps improve public safety.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>As criticism escalated, ICE shifted to downplaying the operation as “no different than the routine,” telling reporters that the raids were the same “targeted arrests carried out by ICE&#8217;s Fugitive Operations Teams on a daily basis,” and suggesting off the record that claims to the opposite were “false, dangerous, and irresponsible.” As it became clear that dozens of individuals with no criminal history had been apprehended, ICE shifted gears and told reporters that in addition to targeting safety threats, the raids were always meant to target those whose only crimes were immigration-related, like re-entering the U.S. after deportation: “The president has been clear in saying that DHS should be focused on removing individuals who pose a threat to public safety, who have been charged with criminal offenses, who have committed multiple immigration violations or who have been deported and re-entered the country illegally.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>As they released their own statements, ICE officials were also monitoring elected officials’ public communications — and strategizing about how to respond to them.\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-center  width-fixed' style='width: 540px;'> \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/10/p.4-1507066458.png\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-article-medium wp-image-150396\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/10/p.4-1507066458-540x386.png\" alt=\"\" />\u003c/a> \u003c/div>\n\u003cp>“Congressman Castro is tweeting about ICEs enforcement operations taking place this weekend in south Texas,” an internal ICE email sent on February 10 read, forwarding a reporter’s query about Congressman Joaquin Castro’s \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/joaquincastrotx/status/830191630108000257?lang=en\">statement of concern\u003c/a> over the raids. “I&#8217;m responding to this reporter using our statement.

Austin City councilmember Greg Casar is saying ICE has taken action in the North Lamar/ Rundberg areas arresting people for ‘standing up for our values against people like Abbott and Trump,’” a public information officer emailed in reference to a \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/GregorioCasar/posts/1331625896924655\">Facebook post\u003c/a> by the council member.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“I think what those emails make very clear is that we have a federal law enforcement agency that’s willing to lie, just like Trump is willing to lie, in order to continue the criminalization of immigrant communities,” Casar told The Intercept after reviewing the emails. “We live in a really scary time where a federal law enforcement agency like ICE is essentially operating as a propaganda machine for the Trump administration.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“They specifically went out of their way to mislead the public by searching for egregious cases,” he added. “And then you can see in the emails that they couldn’t find egregious cases.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In fact, ICE’s attempts to provide “egregious” examples of criminals being apprehended in the raids were lagging, the emails suggest. On February 11, an official responded to a colleague’s list of egregious cases by pointing out that they were unrelated to the ongoing operation. “The arrest dates are before any operation and even before the EO&#8217;s.

ICE dismissed such arrests as “collateral apprehensions,” suggesting that those apprehended were picked up because they might have been with someone who was wanted.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But many in the city felt that Austin was being targeted for a different reason — a political one.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Days after Trump’s election, Austin’s Sheriff-Elect Sally Hernandez, a Democrat, reiterated her campaign promise to turn Austin into Texas’s first &#8220;sanctuary city.&#8221; “The sheriff’s office will not be part of a deportation force that sacrifices hundreds and thousands of people, our neighbors, to a broken federal immigration system,” Hernandez \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/11/29/new-sanctuary-cities-in-texas-vow-to-resist-donald-trumps-deportations/\">said in November\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Hernandez, who was dubbed “sanctuary Sally” by conservative media, faced an uphill battle. Texas’s Republican Gov. Greg Abbott called her refusal to honor ICE requests a “betrayal” of her oath and \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/02/03/texas-governor-goes-to-war-with-austin-over-immigration-enforcement/\">cut $1.5 million\u003c/a> in criminal justice-related grants to Travis County. In May, Abbott signed into law Senate Bill 4, or “SB4,” one of the harshest anti-sanctuary legislations in the country, the constitutionality of which is being \u003ca href=\"https://www.aclu.org/blog/immigrants-rights/state-and-local-immigration-laws/fight-kill-texas-anti-immigrant-law-sb4-not\">disputed in court\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But as the battle over sanctuary cities is fought at the state level, the federal government has other ways to go after defiant local officials: It can make their cities targets for enforcement.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In Austin’s case, rumors that the raids there had been in retaliation for Hernandez’s stance against ICE swirled for weeks, and in March, they appeared to be confirmed by a federal judge who said in court that Austin was being targeted “as a result of the sheriff’s new policy.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Andrew Austin, a U.S. magistrate judge in the city, made the remarks during a hearing in the case of Juan Coronilla-Guerrero, an undocumented Mexican immigrant who had been detained during the February raids. Coronilla-Guerrero’s case had alarmed immigrant advocates, lawyers, and — the hearing transcript shows — the judge himself because ICE had apprehended him as he exited a courthouse, where he had gone to clear two unrelated charges.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The hearing transcript reveals a level of confusion as court officials began to face the new administration’s immigration policies.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“So this isn&#8217;t totally germane, but you&#8217;re here and it gives me an opportunity to ask some questions because we&#8217;ve been wondering exactly what the new policies will be because things have changed a bit,” the judge said, addressing ICE agent Laron Bryant, one of the agents who arrested Coronilla-Guerrero, before proceeding to quiz him on what courts might expect to see from the new administration.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In that exchange, Austin also revealed that shortly before the raids had begun, he and a fellow judge had been briefed by a senior ICE agent about the upcoming operation, which came in response to Hernandez’s policy, “because the meetings that occurred between the field office director and the sheriff didn’t go very well,” he said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In an email to The Intercept, Austin declined to comment &#8220;any further than what was said in court.” Mark Lane, the other federal judge, who, according to Austin, was also briefed by ICE, declined to comment. A spokesperson for Hernandez wrote in an email to The Intercept that the sheriff “won’t comment on an allegation based on supposition.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>ICE denied targeting Travis County, calling statements that the raids were retaliatory “rumors” and “inaccurate.” But by that point, few seemed to believe the agency. “I&#8217;m sorry that ICE lied to me because they told me there was not a target,” said Gerald Daugherty, Travis County’s Republican commissioner. “I have to think a judge is telling the truth.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>As accusations that the Austin raids were political payback piled up, the agency issued a statement saying that “more ICE operational activity is required to conduct at-large arrests in any law enforcement jurisdiction that fails to honor ICE immigration detainers.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>That was ostensibly the reasoning behind the raids in September as well, which the agency said “focused on cities and regions where ICE deportation officers are denied access to jails and prisons to interview suspected immigration violators or jurisdictions where ICE detainers are not honored.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Immigration advocates say that the focus on sanctuary cities is “politically motivated.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“Yet again, the Trump administration is attempting to terrorize immigrant communities, keep families in fear, and undermine the trust immigrants have in cities that refuse to subsidize federal immigration enforcement,” said Ana María Archila, co-executive director of the Center for Popular Democracy. “Knowing how often ICE has lied about the true purpose of their raids before, it is hard for us to believe any of their claims about Operation Safe City.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>ICE’s Acting Director Thomas Homan said in a statement announcing the more recent raids that ICE was being “forced to dedicate more resources to conduct at-large arrests in these communities.&#8221; But he was more blunt about the administration’s intention in a \u003ca href=\"http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/ice-chief-80-jump-in-illegal-targets-readies-national-sanctuary-crackdown/article/2629001\">July interview\u003c/a>, in which he called sanctuary cities “ludicrous” and made no secret of why he was going after them. “The president recognizes that you&#8217;ve got to have a true interior enforcement strategy to make it uncomfortable for them.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>That retaliation has already had an inhibiting effect on some local officials, said Casar, the Austin city council member. “They’re not saying they’re deploying extra federal agents to a dangerous area. &#8230; It’s retaliation based on a political reason, not based on any kind of law enforcement purpose,” he said. “These raids really are a terrifying tool and the idea that the Trump administration would specifically use those in places where there’s political disagreement is a really scary thing.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>When he and other local officials take action on immigration issues — for instance, by suing the state over SB4 — they now always ask themselves, “What is the level of potential exposure this has on our constituents?” Casar added. “That’s real political repression, and while it may sound great to say, ‘We just need to do it anyway because we can’t be intimidated by that’ — when you’re in the position of making those decisions, when there are real lives at stake, you really do have to think about it.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>There is no question that there are lives at stake.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While Austin’s comments on the retaliatory nature of the Travis County raids drew fleeting attention to the politicization of federal enforcement operations, Coronilla-Guerrero, the man whose case was under review that day, was eventually deported, despite his wife telling the judge that his life would be at risk in Mexico, from where he had fled because of gang threats.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Last month, armed men dragged Coronilla-Guerrero out of the relatives’ home where he had been staying in the state of Guanajuato, while he was asleep with one of his children. His body was found on the street the next morning.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"caption\">Top photo: In this photo provided by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE agents at a home in Atlanta, during a targeted enforcement operation on Feb. 9, 2017.\u003c/p>\n","credit_additional_reporting":"","credit_additional_reporting_users_object":"","credit_photo_illustration":"","credit_research":"","credit_research_users_object":"","credit_translation":"","credit_translation_users_object":"","date":"2017-10-04T18:41:27+00:00","date_local":"2017-10-04T14:41:27+00:00","documents":"","excerpt":"ICE officials were instructed to find examples of \"egregious\" cases in a campaign to portray undocumented immigrants as hardened criminals.","excerpt_type":"default","feature_header_background_color":"","feature_header_color":"","feature_header_layout":"default","feature_image_mask":"normal","feature_interactive_url":"","feature_text_color":"","feature_title":"Featured News","featured_video_url":"","hide_featured_image":false,"inline_featured_image":false,"is_banner_hidden":false,"is_feature":"0","language":{"code":"en","name":"English","slug":"english"},"language_related_post_ids":"","language_related_post_permalinks":"","layout":"default","link":"https://theintercept.com/2017/10/04/ice-raids-trump-immigration-deportation/","meta":{"links":[]},"mobile_thumbnail":null,"partner_feeds":[{"name":"Medium","slug":"medium"},{"name":"Smart News","slug":"smart-news"},{"name":"Spoken Layer","slug":"spoken-layer"},{"name":"Uproxx","slug":"uproxx"}],"partnership":{"article_logo":"","article_logo_blurb":"In partnership with","article_text_color":"#AAAAAA","homepage_background_color":"#EEEEEE","homepage_featured":"0","homepage_logo":"","homepage_logo_blurb":"In partnership with","homepage_text_color":"#111111","module_type":"default","partner":"default","partner_url":"","video_module_post_description":"","video_module_post_image":"","video_module_post_title":""},"post_type":"post","related_post_ids":"148391,146909,146525,139190","related_post_permalinks":["https://theintercept.com/2017/10/01/immigrants-helped-prosecutors-after-escaping-death-in-a-smugglers-truck-now-theyre-being-deported/","https://theintercept.com/2017/09/19/gay-ghana-asylum-us-immigration-ice-deportation/","https://theintercept.com/2017/09/15/refugees-were-devastated-by-travel-ban-u-s-diplomats-told-bosses-detailing-despair/","https://theintercept.com/2017/09/15/trump-adviser-spent-a-decade-using-street-gang-ms-13-to-justify-anti-immigrant-agenda-now-its-happening/"],"series":"","series_part_number":"","share_twitter_text":"Internal emails show ICE agents struggling to substantiate Trump’s lies about immigrants","show_donations_promo":true,"show_in_recirculation":true,"slug":"ice-raids-trump-immigration-deportation","thumbnail":{"ID":150170,"alt_text":"In this Feb. 9, 2017, photo provided U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE agents at a home in Atlanta, during a targeted enforcement operation aimed at immigration fugitives, re-entrants and at-large criminal aliens.

Trump arrived\u003c/u> in Puerto Rico on Tuesday and immediately began lauding himself and his administration for their response to Hurricane Maria. But mixed in with the self-congratulation were \u003ca href=\"https://www.vox.com/2017/10/3/16411488/trump-remarks-puerto-rico\">several references\u003c/a> to how much relief efforts were costing.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“Our country has really gone all out,” Trump said. “It&#8217;s not only dangerous, it&#8217;s expensive. But I consider it a great honor.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Trump then explained that Director of the Office of Management and Budget &#8220;Mick Mulvaney is here, and Mick is in charge of a thing called budget. I hate to tell you, Puerto Rico, but you are throwing our budget out of whack. We spent a lot of money on Puerto Rico, and that&#8217;s fine. We saved a lot of lives.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Beyond the gross inappropriateness of “joking” about the money the U.S. government is spending even as American citizens continue to die in Puerto Rico, Trump’s attitude is incredibly bad economics. Moreover, his administration, Mulvaney definitely included, knows this.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Mulvaney let the secret out \u003ca href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mick-mulvaney-omb-deficits_us_59d3bcf2e4b06226e3f3e34b\">on CNN Sunday\u003c/a> when talking about Trump’s proposed tax cuts:\u003c/p>\n\u003cblockquote>\u003cp>We need to have new deficits. … We need to have the growth. … If we simply look at [these tax cuts] as being deficit-neutral, you’re never going to get the type of tax reform and tax reductions that you need to get to sustain 3 percent economic growth.\u003c/p>\u003c/blockquote>\n\u003cp>This shouldn’t have been remarkable, because by describing federal deficits as a positive good, Mulvaney was essentially saying that the sky is blue. But it was genuinely shocking, because whenever Democrats are in power, the Republican Party unites to chant in unison that the sky is green. And Democrats play along.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>To understand the significance of this, it’s necessary to look back at the past 100 years.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The world learned a counterintuitive but central insight about capitalism during the 20\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 13.3333px\">th\u003c/span> century: \u003cem>It’s just too productive.\u003c/em> It tends to create much more supply than there is effective demand.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This doesn’t mean that capitalist countries don’t have children who go hungry or people who need to buy a new car but can’t. Far from it. Rather, it means that capitalism is extraordinarily inventive and usually generates the \u003cem>physical ability\u003c/em> to produce that food and those cars &#8212; but not enough customers who can afford to buy it all. Simultaneously, there will be a small number of billionaires at the top with far more money than they could ever spend.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>These frequent gluts of supply are why capitalist economies often fall into slow growth and even long-term recessions and depressions. When there’s more stuff than can be bought, factories fire some of the workers making it, then the workers who were fired are forced to buy less, then the factories fire more people, in an ongoing vicious cycle.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>One of the best weapons against this, as the U.S. and the rest of the world discovered by ending the Great Depression via World War II, is for the government to run deficits by cutting taxes or increasing spending or both. Well-designed deficits will put money in the pocket of people who don’t have much and will spend it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But even if deficits generally make life better for most people, from the perspective of the 1 percent, they’re politically repellent. A fast-growing economy means low unemployment, which puts more power in the hands of workers and less in the hands of employers. It also may generate higher prices, which reduce the value of most kinds of bonds. (A classic explanation of why we have the ability to choose to create economic booms, and the intense resistance among the rich to their countries making such a choice, is the 1943 article, “\u003ca href=\"http://delong.typepad.com/kalecki43.pdf\">Political Aspects of Full Employment\u003c/a>” by Polish economist Michael Kalecki.)\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Thus, Republicans pretend to care about deficits during Democratic administrations because they’re desperate to prevent their opponents from benefiting from deficits’ positive effects. Meanwhile, Democratic deficits are often run up with social spending rather than tax cuts, which Republicans oppose because they worry the spending will lead to future tax hikes. (And some just don&#8217;t like social spending, period.) But when the GOP takes power, it immediately discards its rhetoric to try to utilize deficits’ usefulness for themselves.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>For instance, as top GOP conservative Rep. Mark Walker of North Carolina recently explained \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/28/us/politics/trump-tax-cuts-deficit-republicans-congress.html?_r=0\">with admirable frankness\u003c/a>, being against deficits is “a great talking point when you have an administration that’s Democrat-led. … It’s a little different now that Republicans have both houses and the administration.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This doesn’t mean that the U.S. can afford anything we want. There are physical limits to what countries can produce (although as World War II showed, they’re looser than we may believe). But it’s those physical limits, not abstract numbers on a government ledger, that matter.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Stephanie Kelton, professor of inequality and policy at Stony Brook University, was an adviser to the 2016 Bernie Sanders presidential campaign. She&#8217;s a forceful advocate of this general perspective, known as “\u003ca href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/the-rock-star-appeal-of-modern-monetary-theory/\">Modern Monetary Theory\u003c/a>,” which says that there are several key measurements to examine to understand how close we are to those limits.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>First, there’s “capacity utilization” &#8212; i.e., how much factories and corporations are producing versus how much they can produce. This graph from the Federal Reserve shows that capacity utilization is 76 percent, a level so low that during the past 50 years it’s usually been reached during recessions. In other words, the U.S. could make far, far more stuff on a moment’s notice.\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-center  width-fixed' style='width: 1024px;'> \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/10/fredgraph1-1507066179.png\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-150393\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/10/fredgraph1-1507066179-1024x395.png\" alt=\"\" />\u003c/a> \u003c/div>\n\u003cp>Then there’s inflation.

Unlike the U-3 classification that’s generally mentioned in the media, U-6 includes not just people unemployed and actively looking for work, but those who’ve given up looking and part-timers who’d prefer to work more hours. Currently at 8.6 percent, U-6 was almost two percentage points lower during the late 1990s, without any spike in inflation.\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-center  width-fixed' style='width: 1024px;'> \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/10/fredgraph3-1507066161.png\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-150391\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/10/fredgraph3-1507066161-1024x476.png\" alt=\"\" />\u003c/a> \u003c/div>\n\u003cp>Taken together, this is a clear snapshot of a country that could easily afford to completely rebuild Puerto Rico, as well as Florida and Houston, and do far, far more besides.

Or, depending on how the politics shake out, they could see their entire bet go south.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ahead of Maria, the federally appointed fiscal oversight board now in control of Puerto Rico’s finances had developed a plan that would wipe out 79 percent of the island&#8217;s annual debt payments, taking a massive chunk out of the payday hedge funds had been hoping to land from the island. \u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">In the wake of the storm, that fight could go one of two ways: Advocates for Puerto Rico are making the case that the devastation means that 79 percent should be ratcheted up all the way to a full debt cancellation. The hedge funds, meanwhile, see an opening to attack the oversight board and reclaim ownership of the process.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">While Congress focuses on the size and shape of the relief package, the battle over the much larger debt &#8212; at least $74 billion &#8212; is being overshadowed. As hedge funds attempt to undermine the board’s legitimacy in the courts, resentment toward the board from a different end of the political spectrum has made the body unpopular for entirely different reasons: It&#8217;s colonial and undemocratic. \u003c/span>The difference between the two? The left wants debt relief for Puerto Ricans. Many bondholders want the opposite.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>President Donald Trump joined the fray Tuesday evening, indicating that he wanted to erase Puerto Rico’s debt. “They owe a lot of money to your friends on Wall Street, and we’re going to have to wipe that out,” Trump said on Fox News. It wasn’t clear from his statements whether he intended a bailout for Puerto Rico or for its creditors. Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney \u003ca href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-04/trump-suggests-puerto-rico-s-debt-may-need-to-be-wiped-out\">walked back\u003c/a> on Trump’s comments to Fox on Wednesday, apparently under the impression it was the latter. He told CNN, “We are not going to bail them out. We are not going to pay off those debts. We are not going to bail out those bondholders.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">As of now,\u003c/span> though,\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> the decision on how much debt to cancel legally rests with U.S. District Court Judge Laura Taylor Swain, and any formal forgiveness\u003c/span> on the total sum\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> wouldn&#8217;t happen for at least a year. Still, motions in the direction of cancellation could be reflected in an update to Puerto Rico’s current fiscal plan, freeing up millions of dollars for both short and long-term recovery efforts.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">“Thousands who lost their homes need urgent shelter, and entire towns are suffering from hunger and dehydration. Inefficiency and the depraved indifference of the Trump administration is rising to the level of criminal negligence,” said Xiomara Caro Diaz, a San Juan resident who is the director of New Organizing Projects at the Center for Popular Democracy. Among the group’s demands is a “complete and irrevocable forgiveness of all Puerto Rican public debt,” alongside a call for a robust relief package and to cut red tape around aid distribution.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Any relief package will come with little assistance from the creditors. \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/09/27/puerto-rican-debt-holders-respond-to-catastrophic-hurricane-by-offering-puerto-rico-more-debt/\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Intercept previously surveyed \u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">more than 50 of the island’s known creditors, and none had offered more than thoughts and prayers to the island, and few had even gone that far. David Tepper, the hedge fund manager behind Appaloosa LP, recently made a \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/09/28/puerto-rico-rejects-loan-offers-accusing-hedge-funds-of-trying-to-profit-off-hurricanes/\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">$3 million gift to the relief effort, \u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">the lone burst of generosity from creditors to have become publicly known.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">In the meantime, Puerto Rico is still trying to climb out of overlapping crises. As Gov. Ricardo Rosselló said in an interview published Monday by \u003c/span>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">El Nuevo Dia\u003c/span>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">, his government could run out of funds as early as this month. It currently costs around $70 million a day to run the government, which has around $2 billion in cash on hand. “But let me tell you what $2 billion means when you have zero collection: It’s basically a month government’s payroll, a little bit more,” Rosselló elaborated.\u003c/span>\u003cbr />\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-center  width-fixed' style='width: 1024px;'>\u003cbr />\n\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/10/Gov-Ricado-Rossello-1507067580.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-150414\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/10/Gov-Ricado-Rossello-1507067580-1024x772.jpg\" alt=\"20170927, SALINAS, EL GOBERNADOR RICARDO ROSSELLO LLEGA A SALINAS PARA ENTREGAR SUMINISTROS.

The board met last Friday to reconsider its current fiscal plan for the island in light of storm damage and the revenues likely to be lost as a result, though there are still few details as to what (if anything) was decided. There are also increasing calls for the U.S. government to devote money not just to emergency services but also to general operating expenses, and to help lay the foundation for more resilient infrastructure. A staffer for Puerto Rican-born Rep. Nydia Velázquez, D-N.Y., for instance — one of Congress’s most active members on issues related to the island — told The Intercept that she is requesting that the Treasury extend a line of credit to alleviate Puerto Rico’s liquidity issues.  \u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Even if the debt is eventually forgiven, the fiscal oversight board will continue to be a presence on the island until the Puerto Rican government maintains a balanced budget for four consecutive years and crafts those budgets in line with the board’s accounting standards. For Puerto Ricans, that could mean austerity measures and a neutered democracy even after the debt is canceled. Yet the hurricane may well have altered the politics around austerity, too, as calls for investment in rebuilding infrastructure could overwhelm the demand for cuts. \u003c/span>With increased attention on Puerto Rico after the storm has also come increased outrage over its economic and political crisis.  VAMOS4PR, a coalition of labor, community, and civil rights groups, is planning rallies in 14 cities today calling for “immediate and sufficient aid to RELIEVE AND REBUILD Puerto Rico,” according to a press release, and to zero-out the debt. The event in New York starts just blocks from Swain’s office.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> The continued presence of the board, however, also means its privatization agenda could continue to play out long after Puerto Rico’s debts are off the books. (The firm handling the oversight board’s communications declined to comment for this story.)\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">The trade-off between at least some level of debt forgiveness and undemocratic austerity has been at the core of tensions over the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA), which created the oversight board and allows for more expansive bankruptcy proceedings than other U.S. municipalities have access to. (For\u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2015-12-03/bankruptcy-was-option-for-puerto-rico-before-congress-goof\"> \u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">reasons\u003c/span>\u003c/a>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> that remain unknown, Puerto Rico hasn’t been able to declare Chapter 9 bankruptcy like other struggling cities and states since 1984.) When it was passed amid protests last summer, PROMESA put a moratorium on most debt payments that has been in place ever since, though Rosselló has attempted to repay portions of it. Since it was installed, the board has begun outlining and implementing deep cuts to the commonwealth’s public sphere.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">In some ways, the oversight board acts as a kind of mediator between bondholders and the government and people of Puerto Rico, preempting some of the most draconian terms built into bond repayment contracts, now on hold under PROMESA and as the bankruptcy-like negotiations the bill outlines proceed in the courts. One such provision would have mandated that the government pay back general obligation bonds \u003c/span>\u003ci>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">before \u003c/span>\u003c/i>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">providing essential services to its citizens. Though repayment is still on hold, different classes of bondholders are now locked in a legal dispute about which of them is entitled to the revenue from the island’s sales tax, currently set at 11.5 percent. A board-rejected debt restructuring agreement would have mandated that rates automatically rise when demand goes down to satisfy repayment, meaning that, thanks to PROMESA, fewer customers would have to pay drastically higher bills.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Though the board does provide a considerable buffer between bondholders and Puerto Rico, for many residents the body represents just the most blatant iteration yet of the United States’s colonial relationship to the island, which has officially been a U.S. commonwealth since 1952. The arrangement usurps any semblance of local democracy and wrests virtually all decision-making power from the people and to a body that’s only required to have one Puerto Rican member.\u003c/span>\u003cbr />\n\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-bleed large-bleed width-auto' style='width: auto;'>\u003cbr />\n\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/10/PR-fiscal-oversight-board-1507134319.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-150632\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/10/PR-fiscal-oversight-board-1507134319-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"31 DE MARZO 2017SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO.

Sensing at least some level of forgiveness on the horizon — and generally frustrated that the board has moved debt negotiations to the courts so quickly — creditors have launched a series of lawsuits aimed at delegitimizing the board and winning more of their money back. \u003c/span>Cate Long, who leads a research service for Puerto Rico bondholders and wrote a recent report for Congress on the status of PROMESA, has been circulating a list of recommendations to lawmakers in Washington in Irma and Maria’s wake, calling for Congress to “consider a tax credit for U.S. multinationals” and the “militarization of the island to provide short to medium [term] security.” The list further suggests that “Congress &#8230; proactively request that President Trump remove &#8230; and replace the [board] with an appointed administrator who has broad authority to execute contracts, coordinate with federal agencies and oversee reconstruction.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In an email to The Intercept, Long wrote, “[The oversight board] is seven volunteers who live all over the US and cannot coordinate easily with all the federal agencies, Congress and White House. They are not prepared for the magnitude of rebuilding Puerto.” The U.S. military, she added, “needs to supplement the 15,000 Puerto Rican police officers to maintain law and order.” Long also said she would be recommending to Congress that U.S. multinationals operating in Puerto Rico be able to write down 100 percent of capital expenditures “required to rebuild after Maria or build new factories within a 2-3 year window.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Perhaps the biggest existential threat to the control board\u003cstrong>, \u003c/strong>which the document above references, is a suit launched by hedge fund bondholder Aurelius Capital Management. Filed in August, the Aurelius suit alleges that the board bypassed the Constitution’s “appointments clause,” a statute mandating that principal officers of the federal government be appointed by the president and then approved by the Senate. Should the case gain traction, it could put debt repayment back on creditors’ terms.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">The creditors have good reason to be nervous. “At this point,” Jubilee USA Executive Director Eric LeCompte says, “no investor in Puerto Rico’s debt should be thinking that they will get any return in the near future.”\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Controversially, Jubilee USA supported PROMESA in the lead-up to its passage last summer, causing tension between the group and other civil society organizations aligned against the measure. As they have in similar kinds of debt negotiations, \u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">Jubilee USA is \u003c/span>now calling for the cancellation with complete restructuring\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> of Puerto Rico’s debt, and has been tracking developments there and in Washington closely.\u003c/span>\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">“Now that the hurricanes have happened, and we understand the level of devastation that has taken place on the island, the bankruptcy process that’s in place under Swain now has to take into account this new reality,” LeCompte tells me. “For Puerto Rico, that means a much bigger haircut than we were looking at beforehand.&#8221; \u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">According to LeCompte, there are a couple of ways that forgiveness or cancellation could play out. Beyond outright forgiveness, one idea that’s been popular even among some bondholders is to repackage any remaining debt\u003c/span> into a bond that would only be repaid\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\"> once Puerto Rico crosses a certain threshold of GDP growth. A less likely scenario — though one LeCompte advised to look out for\u003c/span>\u003cb>, \u003c/b>and Trump himself may have suggested \u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">— could see Congress pass a bail-out for bondholders, pouring federal funds into recouping their losses. Another recourse for creditors, he tells me, “is trying to get Congress to amend or change PROMESA legislation to disempower the bankruptcy process.” \u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400\">LeCompte, though, says signals now are stronger than they’ve ever been for cancellation or deep forgiveness — thanks both to Maria’s devastation and to active pressure from Puerto Rican organizers there and in the diaspora. “In a financial crisis, you’re killing people slowly,” he says, “When these hurricanes hit — when there’s no electricity and no power — you’re watching people get killed quickly.”\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Correction: Oct. 4, 2017, 2:11 p.m.\u003c/strong>\u003cbr />\n\u003cem>An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that Puerto Rico has officially been a U.S. commonwealth since 1898.

Trump threw rolls of paper towels at hurricane survivors in Puerto Rico and gave himself an A+ for his (lack of a) response to the disaster. Alynda Segarra of Hurray for the Riff Raff shares stories about exploring her Puerto Rican roots and performs what turned out to be prescient songs from her new album, The Navigator. Former U.S. Army Ranger Rory Fanning talks about how his slain comrade, former NFL star-turned soldier Pat Tillman, supported his decision to become a conscientious objector.

They often attribute attacks by &#8220;clustering&#8221; malicious files, IP addresses, and servers that get reused across hacking operations, knowing that threat actors use the same code and infrastructure repeatedly to save time and effort.

Once the other group&#8217;s tools and source code are stolen, it&#8217;s easy to go a step further and reuse them.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&#8220;Agency A could steal another agency&#8217;s source code and leverage it as their own. Clustering and attribution in this case begin to fray,&#8221; wrote Juan Andrés Guerrero-Saade, principal security researcher with Kaspersky, and his colleague, Costin Raiu, who leads Kaspersky&#8217;s global research and analysis team.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&#8220;[O]ur point in the paper was: This is what it would look like [if someone were to do a false-flag operation] … and these are the cases where we&#8217;ve seen people trying and failing,&#8221; said Guerrero-Saade.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"gmail-p4\">The recent WannaCry ransomware outbreak is an obvious example of malware theft and reuse. Last year, a mysterious group known as the Shadow Brokers stole a cache of hacking tools that belonged to the National Security Agency and posted them online months later. One of the tools — a so-called zero-day exploit, targeting a previously unknown vulnerability — was repurposed by the hackers behind WannaCry to spread their attack. In this case, it was easy to make a connection between the theft of the NSA code and its reuse with WannaCry, because the original theft was well-publicized. But other cases of theft and reuse won&#8217;t likely be so obvious, leaving researchers in the dark about who is really conducting an attack.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"gmail-p4\">\u003cspan class=\"gmail-s1\">&#8220;[I]f a superpower … were to break fully into, let&#8217;s say, the DarkHotel group tomorrow and steal all of their code and have access to all of their [command-and-control infrastructure], we&#8217;re not going to find out about that monumental event,&#8221; \u003c/span>\u003cspan class=\"gmail-s2\">Guerrero-Saade told The Intercept, referring to a hacker group that has conducted a series \u003ca href=\"https://www.wired.com/2014/11/darkhotel-malware/\">of sophisticated attacks against guests in luxury hotels\u003c/a>.\u003c/span>\u003cspan class=\"gmail-s1\">&#8220;At that point, they&#8217;re in a position to mimic those operations to a T … without anyone knowing.&#8221;\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"gmail-p4\">\u003cdiv class='img-wrap align-center  width-fixed' style='width: 1024px;'> \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-03-at-12.18.51-PM-1507065392.jpg\">\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-150385\" src=\"https://theintercept.com/wp-uploads/sites/1/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-03-at-12.18.51-PM-1507065392-1024x560.jpg\" alt=\"Screen-Shot-2017-10-03-at-12.18.51-PM-1507065392\" />\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"caption\">Juan Andrés Guerrero-Saade, right, principal security researcher at Kaspersky, talks about false-flag operations at the Virus Bulletin conference in Denver last year.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"gmail-p4\">\u003cp class='caption source' style=''>Screenshot: Virus Bulletin YouTube\u003c/p>\u003c/div>\u003c/p>\n\u003ch3 class=\"gmail-p1\">\u003cspan class=\"gmail-s1\">Spying on Spies\u003c/span>\u003c/h3>\n\u003cp class=\"gmail-p1\">\u003cspan class=\"gmail-s1\">\u003cu>It&#8217;s no secret\u003c/u> that spies spy on spies. Documents provided by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden \u003ca href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/new-snowden-docs-indicate-scope-of-nsa-preparations-for-cyber-battle-a-1013409-2.html\">describe\u003c/a> how the agency and its spying partners routinely inspect the machines of victims they hack to see if other hackers are lurking inside. The NSA has a custom anti-virus-like tool called \u003ca href=\"https://www.eff.org/files/2015/01/23/20150117-speigel-csec_document_about_the_recognition_of_trojans_and_other_network_based_anomaly_.pdf\">ReplicantFarm\u003c/a> that it deploys on systems it hacks to check for the presence of other known actors. The agency does this to ensure that the tools of other actors won&#8217;t interfere with its own operations in the machine, and to study the tools and methods of these actors to inform both offensive operations and its defense of U.S. government networks. The NSA will grab these tools and reverse-engineer them — sometimes copying clever techniques for use in its own operations.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Though copying techniques is common for the NSA, two former NSA hackers tell The Intercept they never saw the agency reuse actual code during their time there and say they doubt the agency would conduct a false-flag operation.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"gmail-p6\">&#8220;When we catch foreign-actor tools, we&#8217;ll steal the techniques themselves,&#8221; one of the sources told The Intercept. But &#8220;there are a host of issues when you falsely attribute.\u003cspan class=\"gmail-Apple-converted-space\"> &#8230;\u003c/span> You could start a war that way. It&#8217;s probably more prevalent in other countries, but in the U.S. &#8230; the goal is usually to be not attributed, not falsely attributed.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"gmail-p6\">He said if any U.S. government entity conducts false-flag operations, it would likely be the CIA.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>An ex-CIA official told The Intercept that his former employer does engage in a form of cyber false-flag operations to hide its identity, but not to throw blame on someone else.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"gmail-p4\">Guerrero-Saade believes the NSA and its partner countries in the &#8220;Five Eyes&#8221; alliance of the U.S., the U.K., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand are likely not the problem when it comes to code and infrastructure reuse for false-flag operations.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"gmail-p8\">&#8220;The Five Eyes in general is restrained,&#8221; he said. &#8220;[But] we all know that the Chinese groups, the presumably Israeli groups, even the [Russian-speaking] groups, are willing to do whatever. The Israeli groups are &#8230; ballsy to the extreme.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003ch3 class=\"gmail-p8\">\u003cspan class=\"gmail-Apple-converted-space\">False Flags in the Wild\u003cbr />\n\u003c/span>\u003c/h3>\n\u003cp class=\"gmail-p10\">\u003cu>The Kaspersky researchers\u003c/u> have seen several examples in the wild where the infrastructure of one nation-state threat actor has been compromised by another. One example involved a backdoor that had been installed on a staging and relay server (used for transmitting stolen data) used by a nation-state group, known as NetTraveler. Kaspersky doesn&#8217;t know who installed the backdoor, but it likely had been installed to monitor the group or steal its tools and the data NetTraveler had stolen from victims.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"gmail-p4\">Another case involved one threat actor hijacking another&#8217;s infrastructure to secretly launch its own attacks. DarkHotel — believed to be a South Korean operation — routinely compromises websites to launch attacks against Chinese targets. One of these compromised sites turned out to be hosting exploit scripts apparently belonging to another group, which Kaspersky calls ScarCruft. This group used the site to then launch its own attacks against Russian, Chinese, and South Korean targets.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"gmail-p6\">In yet another case, Kaspersky researchers found a trojan backdoor called Decafett that appeared to be tied to the Lazarus and BlueNoroff groups  —  both believed to be connected to North Korea — while also using an obscure and unusual Dynamic DNS provider that previously had only been used by the DarkHotel group.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"gmail-p6\">And a mysterious hacking group known as TigerMilk used a digital certificate in attacks on the Peruvian military and government institutions that had famously been used in the Stuxnet assault on Iran&#8217;s nuclear program. The authors of Stuxnet, believed to be the NSA and Israeli intelligence, had signed their malicious code with a digital certificate stolen from a company in Taiwan to trick the machines in Iran into thinking their malicious files were legitimate software from this company.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"gmail-p6\">TigerMilk used the same certificate to sign its malicious files, but it did so long after the certificate had gained infamy in the Stuxnet attack and long after the certificate had been revoked and made invalid. Because an invalid certificate is of little use to attackers to help them get malicious code on to a machine, the Kaspersky researchers surmised that the only reason TigerMilk used it in their attacks was &#8220;to fool incident responders and researchers into casting blame on the notorious Stuxnet team.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"gmail-p11\">\u003cspan class=\"gmail-s1\">It might seem that all attribution becomes suspect if hacking groups steal and reuse the tools of adversaries in order to cast suspicion on them. But the Kaspersky researchers said that true false-flag operations are rare and difficult to pull off. All of these examples they uncovered involved fairly unsophisticated attempts to confuse researchers. To effectively pin an attack on another player, a hacking team has to convincingly copy or mimic \u003ci>all\u003c/i> of the other group&#8217;s \u003c/span>\u003cspan class=\"gmail-s2\">tactics, techniques, and procedures\u003c/span>\u003cspan class=\"gmail-s1\">, not just some of them. Make one mistake and the illusion can collapse.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"gmail-p4\">\u003cspan class=\"gmail-s1\">&#8220;[I]n order to claim an amazing, true … false-flag operation where you genuinely embodied somebody else in every possible way,\u003c/span>\u003cspan class=\"gmail-s2\"> y\u003c/span>\u003cspan class=\"gmail-s1\">ou have to know how they function in every possible way … how they act when they&#8217;re in the victim boxes, [you need to use] the source code and the payloads and the same encryption, the same command-and-control infrastructure — because any anomalies are the things we latch onto and say, OK that doesn&#8217;t look right,&#8221; said \u003c/span>\u003cspan class=\"gmail-s2\">Guerrero-Saade\u003c/span>\u003cspan class=\"gmail-s1\"> \u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"gmail-p12\">\u003cspan class=\"gmail-s2\">Guerrero-Saade\u003c/span> pointed to a recent case in which the research community was tracking what appeared to be a previously unknown Russian-speaking nation-state group. For six to eight months, researchers watched the group carefully and suspected it might actually be a well-known Russian-speaking group named Turla — except the code and infrastructure the group used was very different from Turla&#8217;s. The researchers were almost ready to conclude that it was in fact a completely new and different group, until the attackers slipped up and used one of Turla&#8217;s old and well-known tools. Instead of an entirely new Russian-speaking attack group, the researchers concluded that it was simply Turla using a batch of new tools in an attempt to obscure its identity and activity. The incident provides a good illustration for why threat researchers need to be patient and take their time when doing attribution, since hasty work can lead to false conclusions.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"gmail-s1\">\u003cspan class=\"gmail-s1\">Guerrero-Saade said that in talking about code reuse and false-flag operations, he and Raiu aren&#8217;t trying to cast doubt on every investigation that occurs. He thinks false flags are rare and that most attribution that threat researchers do is accurate. \u003c/span>But researchers need to rethink the limitations and parameters of what they can know for sure, &#8220;so that we know when we&#8217;re faltering and so that we know when we&#8217;re being tricked and so we can admit when we cannot know. There \u003ci>are\u003c/i> situations when we cannot know.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n","credit_additional_reporting":"","credit_additional_reporting_users_object":"","credit_photo_illustration":"","credit_research":"","credit_research_users_object":"","credit_translation":"","credit_translation_users_object":"","date":"2017-10-04T10:00:58+00:00","date_local":"2017-10-04T06:00:58+00:00","documents":"","excerpt":"Researchers

The Baupost Group, a Boston-based hedge fund managed by billionaire Seth Klarman, owns nearly $1 billion of Puerto Rican debt, purchased under a shell company subsidiary and hidden from public scrutiny. Baupost acquired the debt through an on-paper Delaware-based corporation named Decagon Holdings LLC, whose beneficial owner had been unknown until now.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“The Baupost Group is a holder of COFINA bonds through the Decagon entities,” said Baupost spokesperson Diana DeSocio. “Baupost regularly makes investments through subsidiary holding entities.” She added that Klarman, \u003ca href=\"https://www.forbes.com/pictures/mdg45ekigd/38-seth-klarman/\">one of the richest hedge fund managers in the world\u003c/a>, did not hold any Puerto Rican debt individually.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Though the island, currently recovering from a catastrophic hurricane, has been mired in a borrowing crisis for years, it’s difficult to get precise information about the creditors. Many of them scooped up bonds on the cheap, seeking an astronomical payout by forcing the island to pay them back at par (or 100 cents on the dollar). This has led to widespread suffering, as punishing austerity has been imposed to encourage Puerto Rico to pay back the bondholders in full. (Only now has \u003ca href=\"http://caribbeanbusiness.com/puerto-ricos-fiscal-board-postpones-furloughs-following-hurricane-maria/\">some of this austerity been lifted\u003c/a> in the wake of Hurricane Maria.)\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Using shell companies to buy Puerto Rican bonds, then, can shield wealthy investors from public knowledge of their complicity in the misery of millions of U.S. citizens.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Julio López Varona, state director of Make the Road Connecticut and a member of the HedgeClippers coalition, which is organized to challenge the concentrated power of hedge funds, said the revelation of Klarman&#8217;s involvement will have political ramifications.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&#8220;What&#8217;s incredible about this is these people were actually hiding,&#8221; said López. &#8220;In the case of this person, he&#8217;s in Boston, which has a large Puerto Rican community. &#8230; Our work right now will be about activating our community in Boston, letting them know this person has been hiding and making sure we go to his houses and his companies to hold them accountable.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In July, as part of a court order to comply with bankruptcy procedures, a coalition of holders of “COFINA” bonds, backed by the island’s sales taxes, were required to supply the names of its members. The largest member in terms of bond value was Decagon Holdings, which had 10 separate purchasing subsidiaries (Decagon 1-10) holding \u003ca href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/puertorico-debt/hedge-funds-disclose-their-puerto-rico-debt-holdings-idUSL1N1KH1FC\">$911.6 million\u003c/a> in COFINA bonds.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But there was no information about Decagon in the court filing, other than a Boston address of 800 Boylston St. That’s the 52-floor \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prudential_Tower\">Prudential Tower\u003c/a> skyscraper in the Back Bay district. The Intercept sent an associate to the Prudential Tower to find Decagon Holdings’ office, but they were not listed in the directory.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>A \u003ca href=\"http://www.mydecagon.com/\">rather primitive website\u003c/a> for a Decagon Holdings LLC turned out to be for a different company. “This is a start-up organization and has not gained any ground,” a spokesperson for the wrong Decagon Holdings stated to The Intercept. “You aren’t the first to ask these questions.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It turns out that there were two Decagon Holdings. One, the startup, was \u003ca href=\"https://www.corporationwiki.com/p/2y7o79/decagon-holdings-llc\">incorporated in Nevada\u003c/a> in November 2016. But a second, which includes all 10 entities used by Baupost, was \u003ca href=\"https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/Ecorp/EntitySearch/NameSearch.aspx\">incorporated in Delaware\u003c/a> on August 4, 2015, through an agent called the Corporation Service Company. As usual for Delaware incorporation, almost no information accompanied that registration, including its beneficial owner.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>800 Boylston St. in Boston houses a number of investment firms, though none of them had the kind of assets that would plausibly include $911.6 million in Puerto Rican bonds. However, Kevin Connor, director of the \u003ca href=\"https://littlesis.org/\">Public Accountability Initiative\u003c/a>, directed The Intercept to an \u003ca href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/05/02/opinion-cofina-deal-is-huge-blow-to-dwindling-attractiveness-puerto-ricos-bonds.html\">obscure op-ed\u003c/a> written for Fox News’s since-shuttered Latino news site in May 2016. Iván Rivera Reyes, a Puerto Rican lawyer and politician, wrote that “COFINA was a creation of Wall Street financial whizzes Goldman Sachs and counts large billion-dollar hedge funds like GoldenTree Asset Management, Whitebox Advisors and Baupost Group as bondholders.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But while GoldenTree and Whitebox were known COFINA bondholders, Baupost had never publicly stated that they owned Puerto Rican debt. When Roll Call asked Sean Neary, a spokesperson for the coalition of COFINA bondholders, about Baupost’s role, he would only say, “They are not part of the steering committee group that is the main driver of the coalition.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This appeared to be a confirmation, or at least a non-denial, of Baupost’s assets. Neary never responded to a request from the Intercept for comment. But contrary to Neary’s claim, Decagon was apparently active in the coalition, according to \u003ca href=\"https://www.elnuevodia.com/english/english/nota/cofinabondholdersheadtoboston-2301236/\">reports in Puerto Rican media\u003c/a> of them “leading” litigation efforts to get repaid.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Baupost had a connection to 800 Boylston, but not through an investment firm. The law office of \u003ca href=\"https://www.ropesgray.com/\">Ropes &amp; Gray\u003c/a> works out of that building, and one of its partners, \u003ca href=\"https://www.ropesgray.com/biographies/k/jeffrey-r-katz.aspx\">Jeffrey R. Katz\u003c/a>, has worked with Baupost in the past.

But the role of signals intelligence in Iraq was not over. \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/2830086-king-of-diamonds-apprehended-in-iraq/\">The NSA provided “time-sensitive SIGINT” support\u003c/a>, including a “summary of contacts,” to aid the May 22, 2003, capture of a top Baathist official, Aziz Sajih Al-Numan, “king of diamonds” in the deck of playing cards that featured U.S. Central Command’s wanted Iraqis.

But that wasn’t the only time the agency influenced diplomacy: In 2002, signals intelligence ignited a confrontation between North Korea and the U.S., according to \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/2829973-uncovering-north-korea-nuclear-programs/\">a \u003cem>SIDtoday \u003c/em>article from April 2003\u003c/a>. NSA eavesdroppers discovered that North Korea was developing a uranium enrichment capability in violation of an agreement with the U.S. When the State Department presented the evidence at a meeting in Pyongyang that October, the North Koreans admitted it was true, the article said, setting off the clash.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“The ONLY source of information on this treaty violation was SIGINT derived from North Korean external communications,” an NSA manager wrote in \u003cem>SIDtoday\u003c/em>. “This is both a SIGINT success story and an example of how cross-organizational collaboration can produce key intelligence. Hats off to everyone involved!”\u003c/p>\n\u003ch3>Orbital Signals Intelligence\u003c/h3>\n\u003cp>For more than 30 years, \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/2830054-new-release-the-fornsat-plan/\">one \u003cem>SIDtoday\u003c/em> article from June 2003 explained\u003c/a>, the NSA had tapped into communications from foreign satellites. Though the program associated with this monitoring, FORNSAT, has been previously \u003ca href=\"https://www.aclu.org/foia-document/primary-fornsat-collection-operations\">disclosed\u003c/a>, this document adds important context. For example, it made FORNSAT sound like an intelligence gold mine, having “consistently provided … over 25 percent of end product reporting.” It also explained what sorts of information the NSA gleaned from satellites — “intelligence derived from diplomatic communications … airline reservations and billing data … traffic about terrorists, international crime, weapons of mass destruction … international finance and trade.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The problem, at the time the article was written, was that FORNSAT was in “dire need of upgrade” because it was “primarily engineered for voice” communications and needed to shift to intercepting more digital communications, including digital video. It also needed to be expanded to tap into mobile satellite phone systems, which “use hundreds of spot beams. Our 13 fixed FORNSAT sites cannot provide the necessary access.”\u003c/p>\n\u003ch3>Leaks Included in 5,000 “Insecurity Records”\u003c/h3>\n\u003cp>Ten years before Edward Snowden gave a trove of NSA documents to journalists Glenn Greenwald and Laura Poitras, a “chief” within SID’s Communications and Support Operations organization \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/2829987-profile-intelligence-security-issues/\">described in \u003cem>SIDtoday\u003c/em> the great lengths the agency went to in order to track leaks\u003c/a>. In a profile of the Intelligence Security Issues office within CSO, this person said that ISI scanned 350 press items daily for “cryptologic insecurities” and maintained a database called FIRSTFRUIT with “over 5,000 insecurity-related records” ranging from “espionage damage assessments” to “liaison exchanges.” This ISI profile ran as part of a broader \u003cem>SIDtoday\u003c/em> \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/?topic=communications-and-support-operations-cso#archive\">series on the CSO organization\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch3>Technology Pushed NSA Into the Tablet Era — and Tons of Gear Went Missing\u003c/h3>\n\u003cp>One theme that emerges from early 2003 \u003cem>SIDtoday \u003c/em>installments is that the NSA was grappling with how to handle advances in information technology, particularly the proliferation of mobile devices and online networks.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>One article in the \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/?topic=customer-relations#archive\">“Customer Relations” series\u003c/a> described several “\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/2829992-dynamic-methods-of-interaction-with-new-and/\">dynamic dissemination products\u003c/a>” to help SID “change with … our customers,” including an initiative to distribute “secret-level information” to wireless devices, a technique for disseminating “NSA product” to tablet computers, and a system to view secret documents on unclassified computers over the internet, bypassing the need for a high-security enclosed area known as a SCIF. These efforts foreshadowed Hillary Clinton’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/how-clintons-email-scandal-took-root/2016/03/27/ee301168-e162-11e5-846c-10191d1fc4ec_story.html\">controversial\u003c/a> use, as secretary of state, of a BlackBerry device to traffic in sensitive government information after the NSA reportedly rebuffed her request for a special secure device from the agency.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/2830027-sid-property-inventory-starts-next-week/\">Another article\u003c/a> highlighted that the NSA was a heavy user of mobile devices even four years before the release of the first iPhone, calling on staffers to help catalogue all computers, including “laptops, palmtops/PDAs, etc.,” for an annual inventory.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The document also stated that $27 million worth of equipment remained “unaccounted for” after the prior year’s audit, which ended just two months earlier.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In addition to making secret information accessible to more people, SID was developing new systems to solve long-standing problems. The JOURNEYMAN program, \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/2830013-what-is-journeyman/\">described in another article\u003c/a>, aimed to develop a system for distributing SIGINT reports to many different recipients at once across different networks with different formatting requirements. \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/2830069-patenthammer/\">Another system, PATENTHAMMER\u003c/a>, collected cellular, fax, and pager signals for the Special Operations Command and also allowed users to access information collected in the past.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>SID was also still exploring the rapidly evolving internet.

In the corporate lingo of SID, the “customer” decides, customers “including all departments of the executive branch,” according to the agency’s \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160416092433/https:/www.nsa.gov/sigint/\">website\u003c/a>. And the demand from customers exploded in 2003, judging from a \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/?topic=customer-relations#archive\">series of \u003cem>SIDtoday\u003c/em> articles about the Customer Relationships Directorate\u003c/a>, an office focused on ensuring that NSA’s customers get what they need.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>One driver of this demand was the war on terror; inbound SIGINT requests to the NSA’s National Security Operations Center went from 300 in the two weeks after the Sept. 11 attacks to 1,700 by the end of the year, according to \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/2829985-information-needs-management-careful-planning/\">one \u003cem>SIDtoday\u003c/em> article\u003c/a>. Existing customers like the Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture “suddenly became voracious consumers” of signals intelligence, as \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/2829992-dynamic-methods-of-interaction-with-new-and/\">one article from April 2003 \u003c/a>put it, and brand new customers appeared on the scene, such as the newly created Department of Homeland Security. SID also increased its interaction with domestic law enforcement agencies like the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Another driver of heightened SIGINT demand was the war in Iraq. According to the \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/2829994-a-perspective-on-the-nsa-usun-partnership/\">document\u003c/a> describing the NSA’s role in war-related U.N.

Noise” explored the difficulties involved in collecting large amounts of data, while “SIGINT Curmudgeon” was written by a longtimer who waxed nostalgic about the good old days of eavesdropping. (None of these columns were up and running in the initial batch of \u003cem>SIDtoday\u003c/em> \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday\">just released\u003c/a> by \u003cem>The Intercept\u003c/em>, but I have written previously \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2014/03/07/nsa-advice-columnist-seriously/\">about “Ask Zelda!”\u003c/a> and \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2015/08/11/surveillance-philosopher-nsa/\">the “SIGINT Philosopher\u003c/a>.” In both cases, \u003cem>The Intercept\u003c/em> simultaneously published copies of the original columns.)\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>One of the cultural revelations in the archives of \u003cem>SIDtoday \u003c/em>is the corporate language that was routinely used. Intelligence reports delivered to other government agencies were described as “products,” and there was a category called the “\u003ca href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2830623-2009-08-05-SIDToday-Does-NSA-Look-Different-From.html\">Counterterrorism Product Line\u003c/a>.” Government agencies that received these reports were known as “customers,” and the NSA has an entire division called the “Customer Relationship Directorate.” One of the \u003cem>SIDtoday\u003c/em> articles published today was titled “\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/2829992-dynamic-methods-of-interaction-with-new-and/\">Dynamic Methods of Interaction With New and Existing Customers\u003c/a>,” and it referred to “product line leaders” at the agency who created “customer support plans” that included details on what “each customer needs.” The customers mentioned in the article included the Department of Homeland Security, Secret Service, Missile Defense Agency, and Federal Reserve. The article was written by an official whose title was “acting chief, customer gateway.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The \u003cem>SIDtoday\u003c/em> articles also convey what officials at the agency were reading in their off-hours. Some articles included references to popular authors like the travel writer \u003ca href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2830626-2010-04-30-SIDToday-Learning-to-Love-English.html\">Bill Bryson\u003c/a>, the \u003cem>New Yorker\u003c/em> writer Malcolm Gladwell, and mid-century economist Herbert Simon. One of the articles released today was an \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/2830090-book-review-cryptonomicon/\">enthusiastic review\u003c/a> of the Neal Stephenson sci-fi novel \u003cem>Cryptonomicon\u003c/em>, which was described in the article (written by a member of the communications team in the Signals Intelligence Directorate) as “an enthralling work that proves to be as much of a history lesson as an eye-opening thriller.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The articles, almost uniformly glowing about the NSA, serve as reminders that the men and women who surveil the world are not machines; they have good days and bad days, jokes and tears, and strange tales about their lives. A \u003ca href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2830621-2010-09-03-SIDToday-From-the-SIDtoday-Archives.html\">two\u003c/a>-part \u003ca href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2830622-2005-09-02-SIDToday-Odd-Jobs-Before-NSA-Part-2.html\">article\u003c/a> from 2005, “‘Odd Jobs’ Before NSA,” listed unconventional occupations that some employees had before joining the world’s largest electronic spying organization. The prior jobs included being a craps dealer in Las Vegas, a developer of crossword puzzles for the \u003cem>New York Times\u003c/em>, a professional baseball player in the Atlanta Braves farm system, a nanny for the daughter of Sunny von Bülow’s first husband, and a “mosquito bite test count subject” who was paid to visit forests and swamps to take off his shirt for a minute to assess the local mosquito population.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>SIDtoday \u003c/em>even offers a window into the hopes and wide-eyed wonder of the agency’s youngest workers, its summer interns. The title of one intern’s article for \u003cem>SIDtoday \u003c/em>in 2004 was “\u003ca href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2830627-2004-08-13-SIDToday-How-I-Spent-My-Summer-Vacation.html\">How I Spent My Summer Vacation\u003c/a>,” while \u003ca href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2830624-2011-7-27-Culture-Shock-NSA-From-the-Perspective.html\">another article\u003c/a> in 2011 recounted that on their first day of work, a boisterous group of interns stepped into an elevator and got a quick and stern lecture from “an older gentleman” who warned that “the only thing you need to know is that we don’t talk in the elevators, and the extroverts look at \u003cem>other\u003c/em> people’s shoes.” The interns silently shared the same reaction — “\u003cem>What have we gotten ourselves into\u003c/em>\u003cem>?\u003c/em>”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Related Stories:\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cul>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday\">Snowden Archive — The SIDtoday Files\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/05/16/the-intercept-is-broadening-access-to-the-snowden-archive-heres-why\">The Intercept Is Broadening Access to the Snowden Archive.

Gen. H. Steven Blum, “planned to take the prisoners into U.S. custody as soon as they were released by the Bosnians. The prisoners would be taken from Sarajevo up to Tuzla.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The staffer was tasked with watching for the possibility of an ambush on the military convoy.

As time has gone on, \u003cem>The Intercept\u003c/em> has sought out new ways to get documents from the archive into the hands of the public, consistent with the public interest as originally conceived.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">Today, \u003ci>The Intercept \u003c/i>is announcing two innovations in how we report on and publish these materials. Both measures are designed to ensure that reporting on the archive continues in as expeditious and informative a manner as possible, in accordance with the agreements we entered into with our source about how these materials would be disclosed, a framework \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/715323533824548864?lang=en\">that he\u003c/a>, \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2014/03/23/facts-nsa-stories-reported/\">and we\u003c/a>, have publicly described on numerous occasions.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">The first measure involves the publication of large batches of documents. W\u003c/span>\u003cspan class=\"s1\">e are, beginning today, publishing in installments the NSA&#8217;s internal \u003cem>SIDtoday\u003c/em>\u003c/span> \u003cspan class=\"s1\">newsletters, which span more than a decade beginning after 9/11. We are starting with the oldest \u003cem>SIDtoday\u003c/em> articles, from 2003, and working our way through the most recent in our archive, from 2012. Our first release today contains 166 documents, all from 2003, and we will periodically release batches until we have made public the entire set. \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday\">The documents are available on a special section of \u003cem>The Intercept\u003c/em>\u003c/a>.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">The \u003cem>SIDtoday\u003c/em>\u003c/span> \u003cspan class=\"s1\">documents run a wide gamut: from serious, detailed reports on top secret NSA surveillance programs to breezy, trivial meanderings of analysts’\u003c/span> \u003cspan class=\"s1\">trips and vacations, with much in between. Many are self-serving and boastful, designed to justify budgets or impress supervisors. Others contain obvious errors or mindless parroting of public source material. But some \u003cem>SIDtoday\u003c/em> articles have been the basis of significant revelations from the archive. \u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">Accompanying the release of these documents are summaries of the content of each, along with a \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/05/16/nsa-closely-involved-in-guantanamo-interrogations-documents-show\">story about NSA’s role in Guantánamo interrogations\u003c/a>, a lengthy roundup of other \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/05/16/the-most-intriguing-spy-stories-from-166-internal-nsa-reports\">intriguing information gleaned from these files\u003c/a>, and a \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/05/16/what-its-like-to-read-the-nsas-newspaper-for-spies\">profile of \u003cem>SIDtoday\u003c/em>\u003c/a>. We encourage other journalists, researchers, and interested parties to comb through these documents, along with future published batches, to find additional material of interest. Others may well find stories, or clues that lead to stories, that we did not. (To contact us about such finds, \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/about/#contact\">see the instructions here\u003c/a>.) A primary objective of these batch releases is to make that kind of exploration possible.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">Consistent with the requirements of our agreement with our source, our editors and reporters have carefully examined each document, redacted names of low-level functionaries and other information that could impose serious harm on innocent individuals, and given the NSA an opportunity to comment on the documents to be published (the NSA&#8217;s comments resulted in no redactions other than two names of relatively low-level employees that we agreed, consistent with our long-standing policy, to redact). Further information about how we prepared the documents for publication is available \u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/05/16/how-we-prepared-the-nsas-sensitive-internal-reports-for-release\">in a separate article\u003c/a>. We believe these releases will enhance public understanding of these extremely powerful and secretive surveillance agencies.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">The other innovation is our ability to invite outside journalists, including from foreign media outlets, to work with us to explore the full Snowden archive.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">From the start of our reporting on the archive, a major component of our approach has been to partner with foreign (and other American) media outlets rather than try to keep all the material for ourselves. We\u003cem> \u003c/em>have collectively shared documents with more than two dozen media outlets, and teams of journalists in numerous countries have thus worked with and reported on Snowden documents (that&#8217;s independent of the other media outlets which have long possessed large portions of the Snowden archive — the\u003ci> Washington Post\u003c/i>, the\u003ci> New York Times\u003c/i>, \u003ci>The Guardian\u003c/i>, \u003cem>ProPublica\u003c/em>). This partnership approach has greatly expedited the reporting, and also ensured that stories that most affect specific countries are reported by the journalists who best understand those countries.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">But allowing other journalists full access to the archive presented security and legal challenges that took time and resources to resolve. We now feel comfortable that we can do so consistent with the responsibility demanded by these materials and our agreement with our source. We have begun to provide archive access to journalists from \u003ci>Le Monde\u003c/i> and other media outlets in collaboration with \u003cem>The Intercept\u003c/em>’s editorial, research, legal, and technology teams. \u003c/span>\u003cspan class=\"s1\">We are excited by the reporting this new arrangement will generate. \u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">There are still many documents of legitimate interest to the public that can and should be disclosed. There are also documents in the archive that we do not believe should be published because of the severe harm they would cause innocent people (e.g., private communications intercepted by NSA, the disclosure of which would destroy privacy rights; and documents containing government speculation about bad acts committed by private individuals (typically from marginalized communities), the disclosure of which would permanently destroy reputations). \u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">An archive of this significance and size obviously presents complicated questions about how best to report on it. There is rarely one easy, obvious answer how to do it. Different leaks may require different approaches. I’ve always believed that WikiLeaks’\u003c/span> \u003cspan class=\"s1\">reporting on and disclosure of the materials provided by Chelsea Manning and other sources have been superb. But that does not mean that it is the only viable framework, or the optimal tactical approach, for all leaks. Moreover, different whistleblowers have their own conditions and demands for how the material can be disclosed, which any ethical journalist must obviously honor in full.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"p1\">\u003cspan class=\"s1\">We have navigated these difficult and sometimes conflicting values in deciding how best to report on this massive archive. These two new approaches will, we believe, facilitate reporting and disclosure while fulfilling our obligations to the public and to our source. \u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Related Stories:\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cul>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday\">Snowden Archive — The SIDtoday Files\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/05/15/how-we-prepared-the-nsas-sensitive-internal-reports-for-release\">How We Prepared the NSA’s Sensitive Internal Reports for Release\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/05/15/nsa-closely-involved-in-guantanamo-interrogations-documents-show\">NSA Closely Involved in Guantánamo Interrogations, Documents Show\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/05/15/the-most-intriguing-spy-stories-from-166-internal-nsa-reports\">The Most Intriguing Spy Stories From 166 Internal NSA Reports\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://theintercept.com/2016/05/16/what-its-like-to-read-the-nsas-newspaper-for-spies/\">The NSA’s Newspaper Reveals the Human Side of America’s Digital Spies\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003c/ul>\n","credit_additional_reporting":"","credit_additional_reporting_users_object":"","credit_photo_illustration":"","credit_research":"","credit_research_users_object":"","credit_translation":"","credit_translation_users_object":"","date":"2016-05-16T15:37:52+00:00","date_local":"2016-05-16T11:37:52+00:00","documents":"","excerpt":"We’ve begun to release large batches of Snowden documents to the public — and to open the archive to greater access by foreign and U.S. journalists.","excerpt_type":"default","feature_header_background_color":"","feature_header_color":"","feature_header_layout":"","feature_image_mask":"","feature_interactive_url":"","feature_text_color":"","feature_title":"Featured News","featured_video_url":"","hide_featured_image":false,"inline_featured_image":false,"is_banner_hidden":false,"is_feature":"0","language":{"code":"en","name":"English","slug":"english"},"language_related_post_ids":"","language_related_post_permalinks":"","layout":"default","link":"https://theintercept.com/2016/05/16/the-intercept-is-broadening-access-to-the-snowden-archive-heres-why/","meta":{"links":[]},"mobile_thumbnail":null,"partner_feeds":null,"partnership":{"article_logo":"","article_logo_blurb":"","article_text_color":"","homepage_background_color":"","homepage_featured":"","homepage_logo":"","homepage_logo_blurb":"","homepage_text_color":"","module_type":"","partner":"","partner_url":"","video_module_post_description":"","video_module_post_image":"","video_module_post_title":""},"post_type":"post","related_post_ids":"","related_post_permalinks":"","series":"","series_part_number":"","share_twitter_text":"The Intercept is broadening access to the @Snowden archive.
